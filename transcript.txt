[41:48] Okay, good morning everybody. Uh, sorry for the slightly late start. I know that usually uh these days I got my stream up
[41:55] a little bit on the earlier side, but uh I had a bunch of driver updates I had to do today. It looks like a day or two ago
[42:01] there was uh like Nvidia drivers that needed to be updated, so I had to do that and I had to restart a couple
[42:06] times. So, a few minutes behind, but I'm here and I'm ready to chill with all of you. It's going to be a great stream of,
[42:14] you know, stream buildup first of all and then Expedition 33 as we continue into the endgame content
[42:20] that I missed the first run. Um, I hope that you'll come hang out with me in just a few minutes here and uh and then
[42:27] stick around. All right, so I'll be right back. I'm actually just going to run and use the restroom and then we can
[42:33] hang out for uh, you know, a while before we begin with the game. All right, thanks for being here. Thanks for
[42:38] chilling and I'll be back in just [Music]

[48:03] [Music]
[48:59] Alrighty. Good morning, everybody. How y'all doing today? Welcome, welcome to the stream. Welcome to DSP Gaming on
[49:06] this lovely Wednesday morning. What is it? It's the 7th of January, 2026. We're
[49:11] a week into this brand new year. How are you everyone? What's going on?
[49:21] What's up? What the dilly? Hello. Good morning.
[49:29] Say it, Phil. Say what? What do you want me to say?
[49:37] Am I going to show you more wrist rests? No. I showed you all the wrist rests yesterday. I'm still adjusting the
[49:43] setup. I'm serious. I'm still tweaking the setup. Um, I actually decided on
[49:49] this end. So, this is where I got the keyboard and mouse for the streaming and capture PC. I actually decided to make
[49:56] this like a step back and I adjusted and now I'm using my wired Logitech keyboard
[50:04] and mouse that I've had for about a year. And I actually used to use it over there at that computer desk when I was doing all that work of like, you know,
[50:11] thumbnails uploading over there. Um, I moved it over here. Reason being a very simple reason. I didn't want to charge
[50:19] the batteries on the wireless stuff. Like I have a wireless keyboard and mouse I was using here and they look nice and they work well, but I don't
[50:26] like the idea that like once every week or every other week I have to like charge the batteries. It's a pain.
[50:32] You have to figure out when to do it. I can't do it obviously when I'm streaming. So I was having to do it like overnight and it was a pain in the butt
[50:38] and I was like why am I doing it? like it's not a big deal to have it wireless if it's just the keyboard and mouse here
[50:45] where it's just for, you know, the editing work and uploading and stuff like that.
[50:51] You know, it's not like I'm I need to reposition the mouse cuz I'm playing a game or whatever. That's what this mouse is for. And this mouse is excellent. I
[50:57] love this mouse. Um, and hell, even this this keyboard here,
[51:03] which is for gaming, my my Asus uh ROG keyboard, I've got wired because I
[51:08] wanted a better connection. Apparently, it performs better wired than wireless. So, I have it plugged in wired and it works great. So, I'm like,
[51:16] because of the way that I redid the whole office, I now have the this keyboard and mouse can actually reach
[51:22] over to the PC with USB cables. So, I actually plug it in directly this morning.
[51:29] Did I know there's an upgrade I can get for the ASUS rock keyboard that makes it AK just like the mouse? No, but I don't need that super bonan. It's wired. I'm
[51:36] using it as a wired device which makes it even better. The wireless is great, don't get me wrong, but I want to use it
[51:41] wired cuz you get the better connection. And by the way, then I don't have to charge it. That was the thing. Like I I I had three or four devices. I have I
[51:48] had a wireless keyboard and mouse here, a wireless keyboard and mouse here, and my gamepad. And all of them needed to be
[51:54] charged. And some days I was like, "Oh crap, two or three of these things need to be charged at once." So now I have to juggle cables and stuff. And I was like,
[51:59] "Why am I doing this? Like I don't need wireless over here. The cables fit. They reach." So instead of doing it that way,
[52:06] I'll do And it's cool, too, because on this side now everything is black. I got a black keyboard, black wrist rest,
[52:12] black mouse, and black wrist rest for that. And on this end, almost everything is white. The problem
[52:18] is they don't have this HyperX wrist rest in white. I don't believe they only It only comes in black. So I can only do
[52:24] that in but this is all white here and this side is all black. Looks pretty cool. It's like yin-yang right in the
[52:31] middle. It splits and then you got white on one side, black on the other. It's good.
[52:36] All this stuff that doesn't matter at all. There you go.
[52:43] Super vonchan. I'm not using the dongle when it's a wired device. It does not use uh the dongle at all. Like the
[52:51] dongle isn't even plugged in. It's plugged in via USB. It's a USB device through and through. So, it doesn't need
[52:57] the upgrade. I need the wrist rest to complete the look. I got to find a white one then. A
[53:04] white wrist rest. But it has to be as good cuz this HyperX is amazing. I don't think they have a white uh version of
[53:10] the HyperX wrist rest. Would I consider XCOM 2 as a
[53:15] playthrough? I don't know. I played the first one and it was all right, but we got bored of it and stopped playing it.
[53:20] So I and then when the second one came out, it was PC exclusive. And at the time I was a console gamer, so I didn't even have access to play at launch. And
[53:27] then we never got around to it. Oh, my hair's sticking out right there. We never got around to it uh when it finally released on consoles. Like no
[53:32] one really cared. So I'm not really concern I never really got around to it or wasn't really concerned about it.
[53:39] [Music]
[53:45] Oh, you're saying there's a dongle that the cable plugs into? Is it really? I mean, you may be right.
[53:52] You could be correct. I have to look, I guess. All right. So, you're saying that there's a hardware upgrade? Not a
[53:59] hardware, a software upgrade for it. I haven't I haven't messed around with that in a bit. Is that through the ASUS
[54:04] software?
[54:10] Uh, see, I know every single one of these has its own
[54:18] Here it is. Oh, no it's not. Uh where what's the software for this stupid thing? I know I
[54:24] have it. I just don't know what it's called.
[54:35] I don't know. I don't know what the software called. It automatically makes the keyboard more responsive. It's sick. Oh,
[54:41] all right. Where did the croissant wrist pads go? I put them away. They're in the closet. They they were fine, but they
[54:48] weren't as comfy. They were like they looked silly, but they weren't comfy to use every day. So, what's up, Abdullah?
[54:54] How are you today? Do I accept get to games on Steam? I do
[55:00] if it's a game that I'm interested in. So, some people have said, "Hey, are you interested in this game?" I'm like, "No, no thanks." And other people are like,
[55:06] "You interested in this game?" And I'm like, "Yes." Thank you, Bane of Deon. You got to take
[55:11] off. All right. Thanks for stopping by and saying hi. What's up, Ortega? Good
[55:16] morning.
[55:23] How the hell do I upgrade this keyboard? I know there's a there's software installed, but I don't know what the hell it's called. I have no idea.
[55:30] It's not in my It's not in the, you know, the the tray of apps running, and
[55:36] it's not in my recent. I don't know what the hell it is. What's the name of the stupid app that's
[55:42] installed for this ASUS keyboard? I don't know. I I ran it a few times and I tweaked the keyboard at the time, but
[55:47] now I don't know where it is. Did they install it on my desktop? Hold on. Maybe it's on the desktop.
[55:53] [Music] No, I don't see it on the desktop.
[56:01] What the hell is it called? I don't see it.
[56:07] Maybe just search for Rag. Nope.
[56:16] Not under ASUS. What the hell is that?
[56:22] What's the ASUS keyboard called? The Azoth. A Z O T H. It's the ASUS rag Azoth keyboard. And it has an app that
[56:30] that's how you update it and and check the stats on it and everything. But I don't know what the hell the name of the app is. It's I've used it before. It's
[56:36] in the PC. I just don't know where the hell it is.
[56:43] Uh, if you're banned, how are you talking in chat right now? If you if you just want to be unbanned,
[56:49] you could just tell me the name you want unbanned and I'll unban it cuz I don't know what you're really talking about or if it really happened or not. It might
[56:55] not be. It might be bologn. Who knows?
[57:02] What's up, Chris? Good morning. How are you? Oh, the Indestas day clean out this year
[57:09] is going to be insane because now because of all the upgrades again, the closet's full of boxes and [ __ ] Like I
[57:15] need this this year the first thing we're going to do for Indestance Day. For those who don't know, on July 4th,
[57:21] I'm now going to have an annual marathon where number one, I clean out my closet, but number two, we're going to bring
[57:27] back all the old stuff I used to do on stream like like wearing vests and hats and things for levels of support. We did
[57:32] it in July of last year. It actually was a huge hit. People loved it. So this year I'm going to clean this sucker out
[57:39] from top to bottom. We got to clean out all the decorations and [ __ ] that's in there that I'm not using anymore. There's tons in there that I got to get
[57:45] rid of. Old outdated [ __ ] I'm never going to use. Oh, look at my classic games which you haven't looked at in like four or five years now.
[57:57] Yes, we are. We're talking about cleaning the closet in July right now in January.
[58:04] Only 6 months away. I mean, come on. It'll be here like like tomorrow. Like,
[58:09] don't snap your fingers. It's it's investments day again. That's how it works. All is well, Batirl. Thanks for
[58:14] asking. There's no rule about mentioning Asmin Gold. No.
[58:22] Dang. So, what is the name of the stupid app? I can't find this app on my PC. I know
[58:28] it's in there. Uh, here. Program files.
[58:37] Aces. Oh god. Is ROG live service? That can't
[58:43] be it. No, that's not it. It's not ROG live service. No. Uh,
[58:52] armory crate service. Could that be what it was? The armory crate service? It might be.
[59:03] Maybe I could try running it and see what happens.
[59:08] [Music]
[59:14] Apparently nothing nothing ran at all. Nothing happened.
[59:19] Yeah, nothing happened at all. What's up, Grandmaster Scrub? How you
[59:26] doing? He says we should do quarterly investments day.
[59:32] And Super Bon John says, "No, let's do it every every six months, spring and fall." No, I like then it can't be
[59:38] invest. The whole idea is you do it on uh you're doing it on
[59:44] [Music] Oh, wait. Is this it? Oh, this might be it.
[59:51] [Music] I can't [ __ ] Here it is. Wired 100%.
[59:58] Got it. It is Armory Crate. It was already running. Here it is. A new version of this device
[1:00:03] is available. Update now. Yes. Device firmware updates. Yes. There
[1:00:09] you go.
[1:00:17] And they're saying I have to use the dongle, too. I don't know if the dongle's plugged in. Hold on.
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:41] I was saying to update I have to use the dongle and the cord at the same time. I don't use the dongle. So
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:01:11] Okay. All right. So, now it's connected.
[1:01:20] All right. So, keyboard update.
[1:01:27] Encountered error. I'm going to update the software first.
[1:01:33] Encountered an error right off the bat. Great.
[1:01:41] Okay, now it says dongle. And it'll show the dongle.
[1:01:49] It's updating the dongle even though I don't use it. Every day can be independence day. There
[1:01:56] you go. Oh, I'm not buying a new dongle. Super
[1:02:01] Bonshan. I just bought the keyboard. I'm not buying another dongle. That's ridiculous.
[1:02:12] Yes, I'm in the Armory Crate right now. I'm updating. I updated the software. Now I'm updating the Omni receiver,
[1:02:17] which I think is the dongle. And then it says to update the keyboard, but I already did that and it gave me an error. So that's great.
[1:02:29] The armory crate. Uh, I'm playing Street Fighter 6 on Friday night, but I'm just doing random
[1:02:35] player matches. I'm not setting up any lobbies or doing anything like that. We're just doing playing it for the first time in ages. though
[1:02:44] the rag polling rate booster. Oh god, how I don't understand what how could it
[1:02:50] be a higher polling rate? Polling rate is for wireless devices. So how could that affect it if I'm using
[1:02:55] it as an offline USB device? That doesn't make sense. [Music]
[1:03:15] Yeah. Encountered an error. It won't even work.
[1:03:29] Okay. Trying again.
[1:03:37] It won't work. It won't update the keyboard. It It says be sure to connect it via USB and the dongle at the same
[1:03:43] time. I have that. It says to put it into the offline mode. It's on offline mode. That's why it's working like this.
[1:03:50] Yeah.
[1:03:58] But it won't update. It gives me an error instead of updating. Great.
[1:04:05] Can I react to the Steam Award winners? Uh, maybe. I wasn't aware that the Steam Awards had hap Oh, no. I did. I was
[1:04:10] aware. I saw that on the front of Steam the other day. I just realized I just saw that.
[1:04:17] Yeah, it's on the right mode. The thing just doesn't work. It's stupid. Yeah, it just doesn't work. It's plugged in via
[1:04:25] USB, so it's supposed to upgrade the keyboard and it doesn't work. Yeah.
[1:04:31] gives me an error.
[1:04:45] Oh, wait a minute. I think I know why. Hold on.
[1:04:53] I think I know why. It was because I have signal RGB running and I think signal RGB was taking priority.
[1:05:03] No, it's still erroring. Great.
[1:05:20] Try again. I have no idea.
[1:05:42] Yeah, it won't stop erroring. I don't know. Being dumb as [ __ ]
[1:05:55] Reopening the app.
[1:06:03] Oh, restart your computer to finish the update process.
[1:06:09] Great. So, it is trying to update it, but it
[1:06:16] says that the computer has to be restarted. So, I'm doing that now. Okay. Yes, I'm using Armory Crate. That's what
[1:06:22] you have to use to update these uh ASUS devices.
[1:06:27] All right. Uh let's see here. A couple of shout
[1:06:33] outs to do. First of all, Chairman Kaga actually sub to the channel on kick and that's our f our first sub of the day.
[1:06:42] Thanks, Chairman Kaga, for that.
[1:06:48] I appreciate that.
[1:06:53] Okay, I think that's it for now. That's our first contribution. Thank you, Chairman Kaga, for supporting the stream.
[1:07:06] Yeah.
[1:07:16] No, the uh the keyboard's working fine. Just someone uh had mentioned it was Bonchan. He said that there was updates for it and apparently a new dongle and
[1:07:21] stuff you can get. I said, "Oh, well, let me check." And it says, "Yeah, there is a software update." So, I'm doing it now. A firmware update. Uh my hair is
[1:07:29] sticking. Look at that. There's one patch of hair that's sticking out of my head. I don't know why. Weird. Maybe I slept weird on it.
[1:07:37] Okay. All
[1:07:44] right, everything's updating now, it looks like.
[1:07:57] It's literally the worst part about Aces. I've heard people say it even eats a lot of memory. I install it two times a month for updates. I delete it right
[1:08:03] after. Wow.
[1:08:14] How's everyone doing this morning?
[1:08:20] More people joining. What's up everybody? Satan, good morning. How are you? No, not really a bad hair day. Just a bad hair patch day. One patch of my
[1:08:27] hair sticking up.
[1:08:34] Let me open the app again. [Music]
[1:08:40] Armory crate. A new version of device is available.
[1:08:46] Update now. Encountered an error trying to identify
[1:08:51] the firmware version. It's [ __ ] up. It's not working.
[1:09:03] I also no no longer need GI Hub for anything cuz I'm not using any Logitech
[1:09:10] besides the the Yeti mic. I'm not using anything over here anymore. What's up, TX shooter? How are you this morning?
[1:09:15] Good morning. Okay.
[1:09:41] You're right. This app does suck. Now it's I said check for updates. It's sitting here. It's taking forever. Like what the hell, dude?
[1:09:50] Okay, it's finally doing it. It's finally updating the keyboard. Damn, that took forever.
[1:09:55] What it is is, you know, I have all these programs running. I have a a single RGB program. That's what plays the RGB colors on my PC and also syncs
[1:10:03] with the with the uh keyboard. The problem is when it's running, nothing works. So like I can't actually get this
[1:10:09] to update or nothing when I have that app running. So I finally got it down now. Now this is updating all the firmware.
[1:10:17] Cool. Looks like it's updated. Nice. Yeah, everything is fully updated
[1:10:23] now. Okay, cool. My my graphics drivers as well. I updated those this morning.
[1:10:31] Now I can turn on signal RGB.
[1:10:39] Get my lights back.
[1:10:44] Simon, today I have absolutely no clue. You guys know better than me. I don't know what content is left. Um, you would
[1:10:52] be able to answer those questions better. You know, all I know is we've been making solid and swimming progress,
[1:10:59] right, in uh Expedition 33. Every time I play it, we end up doing more and more. We fought the super boss Clea. Right
[1:11:06] now, we're in a gestal optional dungeon, and it's pretty fun. Um,
[1:11:14] [Music] and then after that, what you know, whatever's after that dungeon's done. I
[1:11:19] don't know. I actually don't know.
[1:11:30] Cool. Okay, our first super chat of the day is a a
[1:11:36] whining troll. $5 from give me back my Twitter saying, "This is top quality content king. Thank you for saving every
[1:11:43] boring and monotonous task for during stream time. We truly appreciate the riveting content." Well, thank you for saving all of your money to send me to
[1:11:49] complain about it during my monotonous stream time. I appreciate that. That's very nice of you for financing the
[1:11:54] monotonous stream. All right.
[1:12:06] Okay. Cool.
[1:12:16] When it's done eddating updating, use control altdelete and close it so that way it doesn't interfere with anything. Okay.
[1:12:22] Make sure it's not running. Uh, now it looks like it Oh, armory
[1:12:29] crate service. So, close the service down cuz it's in background processing.
[1:12:35] It says it's taking up like nothing. It's It's very little use of memory.
[1:12:40] Very little.
[1:12:46] So, doesn't seem to be a big deal on my my setup.
[1:12:53] H, that's funny. Save us GTA says, "Name a more iconic duo than fills trolls with bad mics." That's right. It's like
[1:13:01] trolls and bad mics go like peanut butter and jelly, right? They just can't talk in any kind of working piece of
[1:13:08] hardware because they're so poor and cheap. Dummies.
[1:13:20] There's no real way to uninstall Armory Crate. It intertwines itself with Windows so much. A wipe and reinstall Windows is the only way, says Pepe.
[1:13:26] There you go. What were my top three games of 2025? You'll know soon enough cuz we're doing
[1:13:33] uh the game of the year awards countdown next week. Tomorrow morning at this very time and place, we're doing the
[1:13:39] disappointing games countdown. Um I seriously haven't even worked on it yet.
[1:13:44] I know what games they are, but I haven't had a chance to to set it up so that I have the videos to play on the
[1:13:50] stream for you guys to talk about. But I'll have to do it later today.
[1:14:03] Aaron says, "Or it's just not serious enough to be worth investing the money." So, let me get this straight. It's serious enough that every time that I
[1:14:09] stream Arc Raiders, my trolls sit there the entire time randomly dropping trying to sync with the match that I'm in. And
[1:14:15] they literally will do it the entire stream every time that I play Arc Raiders. This is like the the end all
[1:14:21] beall of their existence is to try to interfere with my match. That's important enough, but it's not important
[1:14:27] enough to warrant them getting a mic that works during that session. No, I think what you're getting at is
[1:14:33] they're just morons. They're stupid people. It's pretty simple to figure out.
[1:14:51] Did you come back? Come back for Clare Obscure. Uh Clear Obscure will start probably within 15 minutes or so. We're
[1:14:57] just doing a little bit of a hangout build up here. As you can see, we got like 150 viewers on YouTube right now.
[1:15:03] Let's see how many we got on kick.
[1:15:10] 83 on kick. So, trying to build up a little bit more of a crowd before we begin.
[1:15:24] We'll see if we can do that. Was that Black Sabbath? I think it
[1:15:29] actually was supposed to be a knockoff.
[1:15:36] Yeah, it sounded like a Black Sabbath knockoff for sure.
[1:15:42] Oh, I like this one. It's a chip tune. Oh, this one I've
[1:15:48] already liked. Okay, the ones that that sound like 8bit or chip tune I've been liking. So, eventually we can build up a whole playlist of just those.
[1:15:55] Any chance of doing Renoir's drafts today? Uh, maybe. I don't know how to do them. I'd be down for it. Like, we're
[1:16:01] going to beat this gestal dungeon. I think there's one or two more spots on the map to investigate. Then I don't
[1:16:06] know. I guess people I guess the Renoir drafts leads to Simon. I'll do whatever.
[1:16:12] I will do whatever you guys think is what I should be doing in the DLC or in the endame stuff. I mean,
[1:16:23] good morning, Antonio. How are you?
[1:16:33] I should do the endless tower first as Apollo people. Some people seem to think the
[1:16:38] endless tower is necessary and important and others people are saying the endless
[1:16:44] tower is completely unnecessary and it's like grinding, you know, content just for people who are completionists. So, I
[1:16:49] don't know what to believe cuz I've heard both. I've heard people say both. Am
[1:16:56] I still interested in playing Marvel Cosmic Invasion? I mean, yeah, but it's basically just a beat him up, so I don't
[1:17:02] know what. There's not much substance to the game. I feel like if I were to play it, it's like a one night stream where I just play for a couple of hours and you
[1:17:08] know what else are you going to do with it? It's not a game that really has a an important story. It's not a game that
[1:17:13] even has a satisfying gameplay loop. It's just a beat him up. You know, again, back in the day, that was the
[1:17:19] kind of day you went to the arcade, you plunked a few dollars of money into, you played through it, you were done. You're
[1:17:25] done within like 20, 30 minutes. But now they're selling it as like a full-fledged game. It's like, why are they even making this game quite
[1:17:30] frankly? Like, I get it. Like, there's a a little nostalgic niche for it, but people keep asking me for it. I'm like,
[1:17:36] you know what it is, right? I might as well play Streets of Rage or Final Fight. It's the same game. So, I don't know what the appeal is really as like a
[1:17:42] streamer. I don't know why people have really been asking for it.
[1:17:50] It's a bunch of trial fights of already seen enemies as Apollo. That's the uh what' you say the endless tower.
[1:18:00] Did I get this shirt from Kohl's? This one probably. I think this is Eddie Bower and all the Eddie Bower stuff I
[1:18:05] usually buy from Cole. So yeah, I think I got this from Kohl's.
[1:18:13] You've been saving coal cap. Cole's cash for 16 years. I hate to tell you this. Opposite of fun. Cole's cash expires
[1:18:19] within like a few weeks of earning it. It's all just paper. You might as well burn it.
[1:18:26] Renoir's drafts would be interesting cuz it's a dungeon. I'll do whatever you guys want. You want
[1:18:31] Renoir's drafts? You want Endless Tower? If there's anything else before those, I'll do it all. I'm down for it.
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:50] What is my slipper size? Uh, the same as my my shoe size. So, the smallest shoe I
[1:18:56] can wear is like an 11 and 1/2 to 12, but usually I get a 12 to 12. Sometimes
[1:19:01] I need like a 13 cuz all shoes are different. I wish they were all actually were the same, but they're not. So,
[1:19:17] Oh, excuse me. A tickle in my throat. Sorry. Have I decided if I'll do the Dragon
[1:19:22] Quest demo? Maybe. It came out uh actually overnight, so it is available now. Um
[1:19:30] yeah, it is it is available right now, but uh I'm not going to play it right now.
[1:19:35] Maybe we'll do it next week because we got Code Violet on Friday. Next week we've got that zombie investigation
[1:19:42] game. That looks pretty interesting actually. It's where you're scanning zombie survivors to see if they've been
[1:19:47] bitten and turned into or turning into zombies or not. I think that looks really good actually. But it's one of
[1:19:53] those indie style games. It's not getting a lot of massive press or attention, but it looks like it could be
[1:19:58] a very unique game for the stream to give it a try. Um, and then what was
[1:20:04] that other one? There's another one too. Hold on.
[1:20:12] Oh, Pathologic 3, which I don't know much about, but someone had mentioned it. So, if people are interested in
[1:20:18] that, too. I don't know what it what it is.
[1:20:29] Well, you're not funny. Just said it. He said, "I fear this will be another weak attendance, low support stream because
[1:20:35] it's an RPG. Why do RPGs get no love in terms of support and viewership? I don't know. I love RPGs. I grew up playing
[1:20:42] them. They mean a lot to me. I find them as chill, fun, challenging experiences.
[1:20:47] Seriously, can we can we get some support today for RPGs right now? Let's go. Let's get engagement. Let's get
[1:20:54] support for RPGs, right? Let's get a good start to the day. Let's go.
[1:21:06] You never played a Dragon Quest game? Well, this one is a remake. Final Final Fantasy. Wow. Dragon Quest 7. This new
[1:21:12] remake. Basically, all it is is they've redone the game with modern graphics and controls, but it's a turn-based RPG.
[1:21:19] It's going to be standard for what you would expect from a Dragon Quest game. It's like a back, you know, an RPG from back in the day.
[1:21:36] So, after I beat this gestal dungeon, what should I do next? That's the question. Do I just keep exploring cuz
[1:21:42] there is more areas to explore on the map I haven't been to yet. Do I don't know. You guys are saying Renoir's
[1:21:47] drafts. I don't know what those are. I know we had those those little painting locations. Some of them don't open. I
[1:21:53] don't even know how they work. Was I a fan of the Dragon Age series in the past? Well, I didn't know about
[1:22:00] Dragon Age when it was new. And then many years later, when Dragon Age 2 was slated to come out, people have me played Dragon Age Origins. And I played
[1:22:07] the console version, which I'm going to be honest, it's a pretty big mess. It's a low frame rate, choppy, hard to
[1:22:13] control mess. They really like they tried to dumb it down to make it a console game. And you can tell as you're playing it's not supposed to be played
[1:22:18] like that. Like at first apparently it was like almost a a a down view like top down view strategy game and then they
[1:22:25] changed it to an action game for consoles which is really weird hybrid.
[1:22:30] Um I still liked it and then I ended up playing uh Dragon Age 2 as soon as it
[1:22:37] came out. And then when Dragon Age 3 came out, which is Dragon Age Inquisition, I loved it. Like I thought that game was outstanding. A lot of
[1:22:43] people hated it, but I actually really liked it. I named it my game of the year that year.
[1:22:49] So, was I a fan of Dragon Age? At first, I didn't even know about it. I kind of played catchup later and now I like it
[1:22:55] except Dragon Age, you know, Dawn Guard or Veilg Guard was terrible. Obviously,
[1:23:00] it wasn't even it didn't even feel like Dragon Age playing it. So, it sucks that they they ran it into the ground. Maybe
[1:23:05] they'll recover someday. Maybe they won't. I don't know. It I don't think that Boware is doing too well, quite frankly.
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:21] I've heard of Crime Scene Cleaner, but Crime Scene Cleaner is a very gory game. Has a lot of viscera, meaning blood,
[1:23:28] guts, and YouTube has been cracking down severely
[1:23:34] on games that they are deeming realistic violence. So, what does that mean? It
[1:23:39] means if you're playing a video game and the game is not clear fantasy, it's supposed to be like a sim, then you get
[1:23:46] in trouble and YouTube will demonetize any videos and streams that have that kind of content. They started this back
[1:23:52] in November. It's gotten worse. Like now, even some people are saying they're playing Mortal Kombat and doing
[1:23:57] fatalities and their videos are getting demonetized. So that game sadly I doubt I'd be able to
[1:24:04] play because it's literally you're on a crime scene investigating someone who got murdered and their body parts and blood is everywhere and that's what
[1:24:09] YouTube literally is saying we want to demonetize. So I'm not going to be doing that game.
[1:24:18] Filipino, how you doing? Welcome to the stream.
[1:24:24] Lost hair in my mouth. Lost and random. Never heard of that one. Lost and random. Am
[1:24:35] I a Bob Dylan fan? Not much. No, not much of a Bob Dylan fan.
[1:24:44] No hate, rule recommendation. Euro Truck Sim, too. I'm not saying I would never go back to a truck sim game. I'm just
[1:24:50] saying I played American Truck Sim for so long, I definitely needed a break from it. Like, I couldn't play it again
[1:24:57] right away. Right. right now. Even if I were to play Truck Sam, let's wait till like the summer. You know what I mean?
[1:25:02] Like, I don't want to play it right now. It was too much Truck Sam.
[1:25:22] Flight sim. See, Flights in I like, but I feel like we did the extent of what we were going to get out of Flights in. We
[1:25:27] played it for like two months, all right, like eight sessions, something like that. And each session, people
[1:25:32] would recommend somewhere new to fly, and we would we do the flyover. We'd tour it. We got to the point where people didn't really have suggestions
[1:25:38] anymore. So, you get to that point like, okay, that's the extent I'm going to do. I'm not going to learn how to really fly a plane. That's not the appeal, right?
[1:25:50] Okay.
[1:26:16] All right. I should play Assassin's Creed 2 again. I might like they did they redo the whole trilogy? I would
[1:26:22] like to maybe one day replay the Assassin Creed 2 trilogy now with
[1:26:27] better graphics and everything. That might be cool cuz those are still some of my favorites in the entire series, you know.
[1:26:37] Okay. All right. So, we're about to get started. We're about to jump back into
[1:26:43] Expedition 33. Okay, everybody. So, here's the deal about this game and today I love Expedition 33. All year I
[1:26:51] wanted to bring it back. Finally, we had opportunity to last month. I did and people showed up in droves and
[1:26:56] supported. Now, we're back to how we were last year. That sucks because that's why I had to quit because people
[1:27:02] weren't showing up and engaging and supporting the playthrough. We're in the endame content. Basically, people are
[1:27:07] telling me outside of this gestal dungeon and maybe one or two other odds and ends to do that really there's the two major things left, the endless tower
[1:27:13] and these Renoir drafts. Okay. So, if you're here, if you're a fan of
[1:27:21] my content, please stick around. Let's hang out. Let's talk and chill and have
[1:27:26] a good time together. It doesn't have to be all about the game. It could also be us talking and hanging out and, you know, just relaxing, having an
[1:27:32] interactive stream outside of it just being about the game. Now, if I'm in the middle of a really tough boss fight,
[1:27:38] that's a different story entirely. I got to focus. But outside of that, we can hang out. All right. Now, today, if you
[1:27:46] can, please engage and support the stream. What does that mean? Please like the stream. Give it some likes to get
[1:27:53] engagement going on YouTube. Please talk with me in chat. Let's have some conversation. Let's not just make it
[1:27:59] about the game so that way we can have some fun even if you're not into it. Okay? Please support the stream
[1:28:05] right now. Not exaggerating. Sadly, Expedition 33 is my least supported
[1:28:10] project. That sucks because I love it and it's game of the year according to the game awards and I'm coming back to
[1:28:17] it to do the content I miss and I'm really enjoying my time with it and it's my least supported game. That sucks. I'd
[1:28:23] like to turn that around today. So, let's talk. Please support. How can you
[1:28:29] support? Well, you can become a member. You can give memberships to your fellow viewer on YouTube or you can do a super
[1:28:34] chat over there. If you're on kick, you can send some kicks my way. You can become a paid subscriber or you could
[1:28:39] gift some subs to your fellow viewer. Or no matter where you are, you could send me a tip using the tip command in chat
[1:28:45] exclamation point tip. That'll give you the link to send me a tip via PayPal. Please support today's stream. All
[1:28:51] right. I want to keep going. People are telling me you absolutely should play and get to Simon. Well, it sounds like
[1:28:57] it's going to take some time to do it. And if I'm going to do it, then I need people to be here for it and to hang out and support it. I can't just be playing
[1:29:03] it for myself. Okay. So, please today, let's get some support for expedition
[1:29:09] 33. Now, the villain says, "Just fight Simon and end the game." I don't know where Simon is cuz I don't spoil myself
[1:29:15] on the game. And from what I'm to understand, I wouldn't be able to beat him now anyway because he's insanely tough and high level. I need to do other
[1:29:22] stuff to level up to fight him. That's my understanding. It's not as easy as it's your fault. Why aren't you just
[1:29:27] finishing it? I I can't. That's not how the game works. Okay.
[1:29:33] Okay. Cool.
[1:29:38] So, dumb [ __ ] troll here says, "I thought you weren't asking for donations anymore. Why did you start again? You're
[1:29:44] a moron." No, we have no goals on the streams, but every once in a while, I can explain how people can support and
[1:29:49] have a call to action. There's nothing wrong with that. Every [ __ ] streamer does it on planet Earth except the ones
[1:29:55] that are multi-millionaires. So, you can eat my ass. I will tell people how they
[1:30:00] can support. And they choose to support or not, that's up to them. But you have no right to tell me what to do on my
[1:30:05] stream. Seriously, you can suck my butt hairs.
[1:30:12] Okay.
[1:30:19] [Music] Okay.
[1:30:28] All right, Shocks. I'll see you tonight for Arc Raider. Sounds good. Yeah, Shocks is currently watching this in
[1:30:33] order, which is going to be a lengthy endeavor. I mean, I'm I mean, I'm part 50 parts in or something like that. So,
[1:30:38] he's got a lot to catch up on. I'll see you tonight, Shocks.
[1:30:55] I literally said I'm not a fan of Bob Dylan and someone asked, "What's your favorite Bob Dylan song?" I don't know. I'm sure I know them, but they don't
[1:31:00] come to mind because I'm not a fan.
[1:31:10] Okay.
[1:31:16] All right. Shall we uh shall we get started? We're going to do an introductory uh
[1:31:22] hour here of the game and then we're going to go on a break and then I'm going to come back another 2 and 1/2
[1:31:28] hours. Okay, so we're going to get a good a good 3 to three and a half hours of gameplay in of expedition 33 here
[1:31:34] today. Let's beat the gestal dungeon I'm in first. Then let's figure out what comes next cuz I don't know what comes
[1:31:39] next. Again, I don't know what order to do anything. All right, I need your your suggestions, your help with that. Okay.
[1:31:47] All right, let's get set up. Here we go.
[1:31:53] Just sit up here. Um Okay, I got to move my monitor. Hold on.
[1:32:10] There we go.
[1:32:29] Oh, the times they are changing. That's Bob Dylan. Oh, I know that one. The times they are changing.
[1:32:38] Very good.
[1:32:51] Go. Lights off. Okay.
[1:32:56] All Oh, volume as well. Got have my volume open here. There we go. If I need
[1:33:01] to adjust it. Alrighty, folks.
[1:33:06] Get set up. Let's get going here.
[1:33:12] What's my favorite Bob Dylan song? The times they are changing. There you go. I actually don't even know if that's the
[1:33:17] name of the song. Okay.
[1:33:28] All right, let's go. Let's get some hype going here for Expedition 33 for
[1:33:35] goodness sake. Game of the year, amazing RPG, revolutionary graphics, amazing
[1:33:41] groundbreaking gameplay. Let's go.
[1:33:47] Come on.
[1:33:57] Excuse me.
[1:34:07] The endless night sanctuary.
[1:34:12] Okay, everybody.
[1:34:22] Just want to check.
[1:34:27] We actually have it on performance. We do. Yeah, we do. That's right. Because we wanted more frame rate.
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:45] Do we want frame generation? Maybe we do.
[1:34:54] I don't know if we do cuz sometimes it chops up. Let's try it. The thing is that's going to turn off VSYNC, right?
[1:35:04] That's going to turn off V. Let's test. Okay. Apply. Cuz
[1:35:17] my problem is I don't want frame. I don't want screen tearing. Let's test this.
[1:35:28] Oh, I just Oh my god, look at that. Oh, that's cool. Oh, by the way, it's one of these puzzles where we blow things. Oh,
[1:35:34] we shoot things. Oh, yeah. I don't know. Is there screen tearing? I can't really tell. Maybe we'll leave it
[1:35:40] on for now and then we'll test it after. But maybe there maybe there is no screen tearing.
[1:35:47] I guess we'll see. Okay, let's start. Cheesy Bear, did you really just send me
[1:35:52] a $5 super chat to complain again? Amazing. Thank you. Please keep complaining and sending me money. I
[1:35:58] really love it when people do that cuz the funny part is even though you're complaining, I still keep your money.
[1:36:03] So, by all means, continue. Amazing. What a concept, huh?
[1:36:12] Okay. Okay. We ready?
[1:36:20] Let's go. Let's get started. Here we go. Hello everyone and welcome. Welcome back
[1:36:28] to Expedition 33 here on DSP Gaming. We are currently in the Endless Night
[1:36:33] dungeon, which is basically a gestal's dungeon. Okay. And if you remember, we had just fought a whole group of enemies
[1:36:40] with a big tough boss guy and everything. And now we have a save point. And in this new room we just
[1:36:45] walked into, I looked up and I noticed there's a huge gestal up there, or at least a statue of one. And as I was
[1:36:51] looking around, I realized, take a look.
[1:36:57] So, there's hidden stuff here you need to shoot in order to unlock an item. And the thing was, it was kind of tricky.
[1:37:03] You couldn't really see it at first. So, I wonder where the other ones are, cuz there probably two more just in this
[1:37:08] general area we have to find. Usually, they're all pretty close to each other, right? Let's look over here.
[1:37:18] Same.
[1:37:28] Oh, that was one of them right there. It was hidden. Okay. So, there's going to be one more
[1:37:34] in the environment that we're going to have to find. Uh,
[1:37:44] maybe it's in that pot right down there. I think it was maybe hiding inside the pot.
[1:37:53] Someone dropped the lantern here.
[1:37:59] No, not in the pot. Doesn't look like it. Oh, there it is. It's in the belly
[1:38:05] button.
[1:38:12] Cool. I'll see you tomorrow. That's right,
[1:38:18] Jade. Tomorrow is Jade is Jade's favorite day. Tomorrow we're doing both Pokemon and Call of Duty. Jade's probably two favorite games of my
[1:38:24] rotation right now. So, thanks for stopping by. I hope you're having a good day, Jade. See you tomorrow. Okay.
[1:38:32] All right. So, we got the optional catalyst. Let's continue.
[1:38:50] The gestals are dead. Oh. Whoa. Okay. Big boy.
[1:38:58] He's huge. Dramatic cooler.
[1:39:04] Please survive.
[1:39:11] Well, I failed miserably. I'm okay.
[1:39:20] I'm okay.
[1:39:29] I want to go back to Virtuos.
[1:39:36] My turn. Prepare
[1:39:43] for oblivion. My turn.
[1:39:50] What's up? That was in B or in C cuz he died.
[1:40:09] This is such a broken move. Seriously, the fact that it becomes stacked damage over and over the more you cast it, it's
[1:40:15] so busted. Beautiful.
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:48] feel energized.
[1:40:55] [Music] Love that song.
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:11] Almost there.
[1:41:16] Crank it. Yeah.
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:28] Let's shop it. Say good night.
[1:41:36] Easy peasy. Good stuff. What's the general opinion of the
[1:41:42] soundtrack of this game? It's amazing, right? Everyone loves the soundtrack of this game. Quick break, play again when
[1:41:47] you break a target. Interesting. That's actually pretty good. Yeah, [Music]
[1:41:56] that's actually really good because if you break the target, they're already, you know, vulnerable. And then to be able to do a second turn, as long as you
[1:42:01] have AP, probably a great great thing. Anything over here? Uh, these gestals
[1:42:07] are all dead. killed all the chastros. Way to go right there.
[1:42:14] But then there anything over here. Everyone's dead. Everyone died. So
[1:42:20] definitely I'm seeing a little bit of screen tearing, but I have frame generation on. So that's why I didn't
[1:42:26] have VSync on. Looks like we have to go this way.
[1:42:36] There just a very little bit of screen tearing. See, right in the center of the screen, there's a little bit. So, I
[1:42:42] mean, if I turn this off, this is the problem. Like, oh, I'm I
[1:42:48] want to use frame generation. Great. Then you can't use VSync. So, then you get screen tearing,
[1:42:53] right? It's like, what the hell?
[1:43:01] So, how are you supposed to I'm Here's an honest question for everyone. All right. How are you ever supposed to use
[1:43:07] frame generation if you end up getting screen tearing,
[1:43:12] right? H because I I always get screen tearing. So I always turn VSYNC on. How
[1:43:18] on earth are you not supposed to get screen tearing if you don't have VSync on? You have to enable VRR in Nvidia
[1:43:24] control panel. I have VRR. I have VRR. It is on.
[1:43:33] So I don't know what you mean. like it's I VRR is enabled, you know, all this is
[1:43:38] on yet I still get screen tearing. So then I have to turn on uh then I have to
[1:43:43] turn on stupid uh whatchamacallit uh vsync.
[1:43:49] I'm still using HDMI. In this case, I am only because that's was the the high-end
[1:43:54] cables that I bought. I could use a display port instead. I could just buy a
[1:44:00] long display port cable if somehow that's better than HDMI. I don't know why it would be.
[1:44:14] Yeah. I don't know. So, no one has an answer. Literally, no one has an answer at all
[1:44:21] about how to get rid of the screen tearing without using VSYNC. Cuz then again, so
[1:44:27] if I turn off the frame generation, right?
[1:44:32] VSync enabled. So, apply. So, now I'll have no screen tearing, but now sometimes my frame rate dips, which
[1:44:39] I've noticed. Yeah,
[1:44:50] maybe I'll do balanced.
[1:44:56] Try that.
[1:45:08] Yeah. See, now there's no screen tearing. Yeah, it's gone. Screen tearing is completely gone now. Yeah, it's literally completely gone. But now what
[1:45:15] happens is sometimes the frame rate dips.
[1:45:25] So, I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out all this technology a year after becoming well more than a year after becoming a PC gamer and I still
[1:45:32] haven't figured it out. Like seems like every game's different, too.
[1:45:37] What's over here? Heck, that's a gesture right there. This
[1:45:44] goes down. See what this gestal has to say.
[1:45:49] Is it a vendor? Didn't expect to see humans here and alive as well. Yeah, it's a vendor.
[1:45:55] Cool. So, fight the merchant. What else does he have? Just general stuff. Power heal, powerful shield,
[1:46:04] charge mark. Oh, civilian clothes from an Elco. Let's
[1:46:11] get that. All right, let's fight him.
[1:46:21] Okay.
[1:46:30] That sucks.
[1:46:46] [Music] No, not leaving you behind. I apparently was
[1:46:52] burning.
[1:47:01] Last chance. I can do it.
[1:47:14] And that's how you do it. Two stentle hits done. Just like that. Okay.
[1:47:21] Now I understand how you reach this place in one piece. Okay, so critical burn 20% increase critical
[1:47:28] chance on a burning enemy. Shell on rush. Apply shell on applying rush. Marking break apply mark on break.
[1:47:36] Goulen ghoulsen.
[1:47:41] So this is for um cl on twilight star. Apply mark to all enemies. Hitting a marked enemy. I'll buy this cuz it's a
[1:47:47] unique weapon. ghoul sin.
[1:47:58] Like I don't have any of these, but I also don't need them. They don't really do anything that I
[1:48:04] need. Yeah,
[1:48:14] ghoul. So, let's see what this looks like on Monoko.
[1:48:22] Nice. It's basically the same as what he was wearing, only a different color. So,
[1:48:27] you couldn't get any of his outfits until basically act three, endgame stuff, right?
[1:48:34] I absolutely, positively recommend Expedition 33. Someone just said, "I never saw you play the base game. Do you
[1:48:40] recommend it?" Of course I do. I love the game. Uh it was uh one of my favorite games of 2025. And you know, I
[1:48:48] I regretted not being able to play all this content back earlier in uh in that year. I'm happy that I'm back playing it
[1:48:54] now. And uh it's amazing. It's a super good game.
[1:49:01] An expeditioner is dead here. Look at that.
[1:49:08] There you go.
[1:49:21] Is that it? Did we loop? So, is that all that's here?
[1:49:31] So, there's no end and no final boss cuz this is where we were. By the way, I missed an item here. Look.
[1:49:39] Lovely. There's no ending and no final boss
[1:49:46] for real or did I miss it?
[1:49:54] Does anyone know uh if I missed anything here? Cuz I I just looped and there's nothing else that I can see. So, do we
[1:50:01] actually just beat it and there's no there's no boss here?
[1:50:06] This is called uh Endless Night Sanctuary.
[1:50:13] Anyone know if that was the end of it and there's nothing else, literally nothing else to do? If so, that's kind of crazy.
[1:50:31] That's it. We came down here.
[1:50:38] That's how we go back. I'm just going to run through again and make sure I didn't miss anything. But if that's it, that's kind of lame.
[1:50:47] The eightball says I'm all good. Well, you know, I judge everything I do in life off of a random eightball,
[1:50:53] you know, statement of of guidance. Of course, we it's how we all live our
[1:50:58] lives, right? It's weird cuz in here all the gestals are dead.
[1:51:06] So, you thought, oh, you're going to probably fight what killed them all, but there's nothing, right? There's no other way to go here.
[1:51:18] I don't know.
[1:51:26] Huh? Maybe we should drop the game. Maybe I should drop you.
[1:51:33] How about that? Nothing there. See, there's nothing
[1:51:39] here. I guess I guess there really is nothing here.
[1:51:50] Just the just this vendor. I guess that's all there is.
[1:52:03] I guess not. I guess there's nothing here. Well, that's a disappointment. Like there was the the chroma here. You
[1:52:08] thought, oh, maybe you find a log or something, but there's nothing here. That sucks.
[1:52:16] I'm pretty confused. This is where we just came from, right?
[1:52:28] Huh. Oh, the stage is for his final mission
[1:52:33] with Monokco. You need to upgrade his interaction at camp. Oh, come on. Really? Then why' they let me come here
[1:52:39] first? Well, that sucks.
[1:52:44] So, we have to we have to come back now. Let me guess all the enemies will be back too, right? You know what? At the
[1:52:50] very least, we did unlock this shortcut. So, if we do come back, we can just go right from the flag, teleport to this
[1:52:55] one, and then go to the end. Okay.
[1:53:05] Well, thanks for telling me so I didn't run in circles for the next hour. I appreciate you clarifying that. All
[1:53:10] right. In fact, do we just do it now then? Let's go to camp. Let's talk to him. And maybe we could just do it while
[1:53:16] we're here. So, how are you going to win back the
[1:53:22] truck? I hear we do the same thing here. I can't rely on. Wow.
[1:53:27] Okay, here we go. Maybe this is the final link. Verso approaches Monokco. He knows
[1:53:33] exactly what Monoko is thinking. Okay.
[1:53:40] No always said that he didn't mind waiting in the queue. Why were you so adamant about bringing
[1:53:46] it back sooner? There was never supposed to be a queue. Verso. Verso wanted us to
[1:53:53] experience the excitement of new beginnings. He gave us the gift of the river. Why
[1:54:00] shouldn't we use it? No found after the fracture. No raised
[1:54:09] me, taught me, protected me. It's my turn to protect him. That's how
[1:54:14] it works. He took care of me. Now I take care of him.
[1:54:20] Except I can't. Because of me. I know why you're doing this and I know
[1:54:27] how it might end. I'm not gambling on tomorrow. Anoka.
[1:54:34] Why help me then? If for Verso and for you.
[1:54:40] For the real Verso. My friend. Verso gave us many new beginnings.
[1:54:47] He would have wanted a new beginning for you, too. What's up, Sell me a waffle? How you
[1:54:52] doing today? He says, "I wish dark and darker was still in a good state. I wish I think you would get a kick out of it."
[1:54:58] I don't know what dark and darker is, but thanks for coming by. You deserve a new beginning.
[1:55:06] If you want one. If Oops. Cook too early.
[1:55:11] Come over here and let's snuggle. Oh, let's get a nice snuggle. Let's go get a little spoon.
[1:55:16] Little spoon. Yeah, obviously Monoko and Verso understand each other more than ever. They We've maxed the
[1:55:24] bond. There we go. We get Monoko's final move.
[1:55:29] And they get to spoon. Amazing. The horrible conversation reminded
[1:55:34] Manoko that actually there's another skill he had forgotten.
[1:55:41] Break point. Does he spoon the enemy during the attack?
[1:55:48] Yeah. Okay. So, you miss DO, don't you?
[1:55:55] Ah, life is more colorful with Noco by my side. Maybe we could stop by the gestal
[1:56:01] village for a little bit. We need more supplies anyway. That would be lovely.
[1:56:07] Are we supposed to go to the gestro village now? Indeed. I think so. I think that's what
[1:56:13] they're getting at, right? So, maybe we have to go to the gestal village to advance this plot.
[1:56:23] Okay.
[1:56:29] All right.
[1:56:35] Take off, son. Here I come.
[1:56:40] Hang on tight. Do I think I'm getting to Simon today? I don't know because I don't know how to get to Simon. I don't I don't know the
[1:56:47] stuff of the game. Like I don't spoil myself. So, I'm just exploring naturally and doing all the things that I run
[1:56:52] into, but I honestly don't know where Simon is. So, we're just doing stuff in order as I find it. What's this down
[1:56:59] here? Wait a minute. Did I even do this?
[1:57:05] Here we go. White sands. I don't think we ever did this. White sands.
[1:57:12] Oh, wait. I did this, right? This was the just the the manor was in the background and we couldn't enter it. There's like
[1:57:18] nothing there, right? We already did that, right? It's the underwater area. Oh, that's
[1:57:25] what that is. Oh, what are the Okay, what are the doors that are paintings all around the
[1:57:32] map? Like for example, this see it says painting workshop. What are those? cuz there's a whole bunch of
[1:57:38] those and we only ever did the earlier ones. I never checked anything else out.
[1:57:45] There's something there. I don't know what that is. There's something there. I think that's the other side of Visages.
[1:57:50] See, here's one here. I don't know what that is. This we have to do. Serene's dress. I think that's the later like
[1:57:57] late game thing there we can do. [Music]
[1:58:04] I don't know what that is. You see, there's a few things we didn't do yet. There's one. I don't know what that is.
[1:58:11] There's a few things we haven't explored. Not too many, but there are a few to check out and try to figure out what the hell they are.
[1:58:22] We're going to go back to the gestro village now, I guess, for this this story that we're working on.
[1:58:31] The paintings are three platforming areas. They lead to a final boss when all three are done. Oh, yeah. I tried I
[1:58:37] don't I think I went into them, but I couldn't figure it out. I don't know if I just couldn't do the platforming or I didn't even know that there was a
[1:58:42] platforming challenge. I'm not sure.
[1:58:51] Okay.
[1:58:59] Someone had also said that if I beat Golgra here with Monokco that you get like a a special reward or something.
[1:59:07] I don't know if that's true or not. And we could try to do that.
[1:59:23] So, what are we here for? Like, what do I do? What's the mission?
[1:59:36] I don't know. I mean, I can try fighting her with him and see what happens, but I don't know. What are we supposed to do for the special mission here?
[1:59:44] No, you're foolish enough to face me again. Are you still angry with me? There's no price for holding the longest grudge. No prize. This area, I enjoy holding
[1:59:51] grudges. Keep me nice and cranky and strong. I thought we had overcome our differences. No, I'm going to enjoy
[1:59:56] destroying you again. Wow, she goes right into the fight. You didn't even accept.
[2:00:10] Wait, what? I insta killed him. Fine, you can stay. Are things settled
[2:00:16] now? No, but you may visit the village if you wish or invite me next time you go adventuring. What the hell?
[2:00:31] That's it. Uh,
[2:00:36] well, I guess we won. It's No. No's lost a significant portion
[2:00:43] of his memories. Memories will He will never recover. Oh, no. Now he's crying about it. Oh,
[2:00:50] that's sad.
[2:00:58] So, is that it? Is that all that there is to do here? Is there anything else to do here, guys, since we're here?
[2:01:10] Cuz I wanted to do his mission, but you know, people were saying the dungeon we were in is for him, but how do I do it? How do we get to that point in the
[2:01:16] story? Is there anything else to do in the gestal town here?
[2:01:33] Bizarre. I don't know. What do you guys think? I need some help here.
[2:01:41] Kotula. Kotula.
[2:01:51] I don't know where Simon is. I keep telling you guys fight Simon right now. I don't know
[2:01:56] anything about it. I don't know anything about it.
[2:02:04] Where's that arena? Isn't there a combat or challenge arena, too?
[2:02:14] I don't know.
[2:02:19] No need to man.
[2:02:25] I don't know what to do.
[2:02:37] I don't remember where the arena was. It says arena right here.
[2:02:43] But we already beat the arena earlier. I don't know if it updated.
[2:02:51] [Music] Okay.
[2:02:58] Doesn't even work. Tournament's over. You guys are a lot
[2:03:03] more entertaining than I thought. That's it. We already beat it. So, there's nothing to do here.
[2:03:23] Oh yeah, remember this? We did this, too. Slick Nick, how are you doing?
[2:03:30] Thank you, Slick Nick, for a $20 super chat. He says, "I started watching you from Kronos. Became a huge fan of your playthroughs and DSP tries it. I love
[2:03:37] how thorough you are with your walkthroughs." Thank you, Slick Nick. I appreciate that.
[2:03:44] That's very nice of you. I'm glad you liked Kronos. I loved it.
[2:03:50] I thought Kronos was outstanding. Uh although there were a few parts that were really tough. I did like the game.
[2:03:56] Very uh you know interesting take on survival horror. I'm glad that you're liking the content and thank you for for
[2:04:02] supporting the stream today. Slick Nicknick. We'll get that on the leaderboard here in a sec.
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:19] Well, I guess there's nothing to do here. We got to leave. Running through the whole village.
[2:04:25] Nothing's changed, right?
[2:04:30] Did I ever talk to journal guy who gives you lumina for journals you discovered? I don't know. I have no idea. Where is
[2:04:36] the journal guy? Anyone know where Journal Guy is? You're talking about I haven't played this game since June.
[2:04:42] I've just been exploring the map doing the postgame stuff. I don't know anything about what you're talking about.
[2:04:54] 1999, right? Yes. Thank you so much, Slick Nick. I
[2:04:59] appreciate that.
[2:05:16] So, I don't know where the journal guy is. I guess we're just going to leave
[2:05:27] an area near me with a bunch of gestures. Look like they're in a farmers market. Okay, which way do I go? Left
[2:05:32] where it says arena and bizaar? Like here? Bazaar. farmers market. What does
[2:05:37] he look like? They I mean, come on. How am I How am I going to tell who I'm supposed to talk to here?
[2:05:46] No idea.
[2:06:03] Vendor What's up? Uh Derek, how are you?
[2:06:14] No. I don't know. Right to the left of that guy.
[2:06:26] So to the left of this guy.
[2:06:35] You found all of the journals. Moshi will be happy. I want to thank you himself once he's had his turn at Sacred
[2:06:41] River. Here's a gift for your travels. Yeah, he's giving me a bunch of color aluminas. Look,
[2:06:47] he's giving me a ton. Sell me a waffle. Did a $2 super chat says, "Here's a treat for Jasper." Thank you to sell me
[2:06:54] a waffle. I appreciate that. I'll be sure to get Jasper kitty something nice with that. Thank you so much.
[2:07:08] Okay, cool.
[2:07:17] All right, let's get out of here. So, how do I initiate this final monokco quest for that area we were already in,
[2:07:23] but there was nothing there? Cuz obviously that's what I want to do, but I don't know how to initiate it.
[2:07:32] Now you can add energizing turn to everyone. Didn't I already do that? Doesn't already everyone already have it? Look
[2:07:50] energizing turn. There is no energizing turn. There's energy master. I'm pretty
[2:07:55] sure I I gave that to everybody. Um what is energizing turn?
[2:08:09] Did you mean energizing burn? Maybe you meant energizing burn.
[2:08:22] You meant energizing master. Yeah, we have I gave it to everybody. Yeah, everyone has energy master already actually.
[2:08:28] Yep. I already gave it to everybody, so we're good there. Pepe Bass just did a $2 Super Chat. He says you should do
[2:08:33] Jasper tries it. Jasper cat tries it.
[2:08:39] Uh the problem with that is that Jasper probably wouldn't stay still. I mean, I guess we give him a treat like like he'd
[2:08:46] try a treat. That could be interesting. We have Oh, you know what?
[2:08:51] You know what? Jasper cat tries it. How about that? And then we we give him
[2:08:56] three treats and he we a head-to-head taste test of three kitty treats and we see which one Jasper likes more. And I
[2:09:03] could do it now cuz now I could actually film anywhere in my house.
[2:09:10] All righty then. So by the way, if I go to camp, what happens now with Monokco?
[2:09:21] Indeed. Maybe we that would be No. So, I don't know. You guys were saying there was a mission for Monokco
[2:09:27] in where I was, but there's no mission for there. Like, there's nothing. I'm not getting anything. All right, I know
[2:09:33] what I want to do. Let's do the Serene mission, which we already had unlocked for a long time and we didn't do it yet.
[2:09:38] Let's get that done. And then there's one or two more uh places to investigate that we haven't
[2:09:45] gone to yet. And then we'll probably maybe, like you guys said, either do the Endless Tower or the Underground
[2:09:50] Dungeon, which seem to be the last two things to do.
[2:09:57] How would we measure Jasper's enjoyment level? I guess I would say which like let's say for example we have a wet wet
[2:10:04] food, a dry treat, I don't know, and something else, right? You put them all three down next to each other. And you
[2:10:10] see what he goes for like what does he go for first? What does he what maybe he'll give one lick of the wet food, be
[2:10:15] like, "Oh, I don't want that." And he'll eat the dry treat, right? That could be interesting to see how that goes. I've
[2:10:20] never tried anything like that before.
[2:10:26] What's that? It's in the water. So, we must have already done it. See this here?
[2:10:33] Anything that's in the water, we've probably already done. Yeah.
[2:10:42] It's saying there's something over here we didn't do yet.
[2:10:48] See, look right here ahead of me. What is that?
[2:10:56] What? Wait a minute. It's above me. Oh,
[2:11:02] what the heck is this?
[2:11:08] We didn't check this out yet. The chosen path. Okay, this is new.
[2:11:16] The chosen path. And it's double O. Uh-oh. What is this going to be?
[2:11:21] I have no idea.
[2:11:43] The path is open. Only one may enter. One warrior, one path. We're ready.
[2:11:48] Does it matter who I put into these? I don't know.
[2:11:54] Let's find out.
[2:12:00] Okay. Okay.
[2:12:27] I'm ready. Let's keep going. Okay, better.
[2:12:48] Oh man, I did it way too early. Let the ink flow.
[2:12:56] Ice shatter. Let's keep going.
[2:13:04] Okay, good. Feeling better.
[2:13:11] [Music] Lightning stone.
[2:13:18] There we go. [Music]
[2:13:26] Okay, I guess maybe we can have one character do each.
[2:13:34] Man, CL, this is gonna suck because I haven't used her in ages. So, I don't even remember how to use her.
[2:13:42] I'm waiting.
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:14:00] Here's your car. Here's
[2:14:22] your card. Take your shot.
[2:14:29] Here
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:46] we go. Final path.
[2:14:52] Missed it. That was pretty easy.
[2:14:58] Seems like this is going to be quite easy to do.
[2:15:06] Very soap. [Music]
[2:15:12] Not impressed.
[2:15:23] Goodbye.
[2:15:32] Goodbye.
[2:15:42] Manco, I think Manoko is my second best
[2:15:47] character now.
[2:16:01] A bit of violence. Yes.
[2:16:23] energized. And that's it.
[2:16:32] That's right. If you are enjoying today's stream, please give the stream a like here on YouTube. It helps a lot for
[2:16:37] engagement. For those watching on demand still, please like the video and leave some comments on it for engagement. Let
[2:16:43] me know what you think of the challenging endgame stuff of Expedition 33. Appreciate you guys being here
[2:16:50] today. [Music]
[2:16:58] Wait a minute. A He has armor. I just noticed. I just freaking noticed.
[2:17:05] Finesse and grace. Annoying jerk.
[2:17:13] Last chance.
[2:17:26] This will hurt. Take down my shields.
[2:17:32] Time to hit you. Lost a chance.
[2:17:40] I can do it.
[2:17:48] Yeah. [Music]
[2:17:55] Uh, Canon just did a $5 Superjet saying, "Please help homeless veterans. There's over 250,000 veterans on the streets.
[2:18:02] Tax deductible donations help a lot. Thank you." Here you go. Canon appealing to help veterans and I'm
[2:18:08] all for helping the veterans and those who have served. So, thanks for five bucks there, Canon. Maybe some people
[2:18:15] will look into that. [Music]
[2:18:20] Although, quite frankly, you should probably give the $5 to the veterans. I'm just saying
[2:18:27] that's how you feel. All right, we did it.
[2:18:32] That was meant to be challenging, you know, if you didn't have great builds and highle stuff for each character, but
[2:18:37] you know, I did. So, pretty easy to take care of there.
[2:18:44] Base shield plus one shield if not affected by any shield on turnar.
[2:18:50] Wait, that's it? That's literally it.
[2:18:56] Well, I'm never going to use that because I always have three shields on turn start.
[2:19:02] That's literally it. Look.
[2:19:15] So, I did all of that just to get a completely worthless pick, though. Great.
[2:19:27] Baboo says basically the Renoir drafts area or the endless tower areas will be the only thing that's kind of challenging to me now in the game. out.
[2:19:38] Go.
[2:19:54] All righty. Well, we did this
[2:20:00] to the sky. Okay, there was What is that?
[2:20:08] I feel like we've already done that, but maybe I didn't. It's old Lumiere. Yeah, we've been to Lumiere. Um, this over
[2:20:14] here to the upper right. I don't know what that is. So, let's look at that next. Then we've got this. We have this.
[2:20:20] We have a few things to do. Let's see what this is right here.
[2:20:26] Flashing through the sky. [Music] Is that it down there? That glowing
[2:20:32] purple thing. Yes. Hang on tight.
[2:20:40] What is this? Look. Sunless cliffs. Danger. I thought
[2:20:46] you said that there was nothing that was my level or tough. Dude, this says it's danger. I'm not even high enough level
[2:20:52] to do it yet. Sunless cliffs.
[2:20:59] So what is this? [Music]
[2:21:12] Try it out. Well, hold on. Cuz there's other stuff, too. Let's do the stuff like this. What's this in the middle of
[2:21:18] the water? And there's this. These aren't going to be danger. I should do those first then and then come back to
[2:21:23] Sunless Cliffs. Let's see what this is. Show something like floating over here.
[2:21:32] Oh, there's something in the water here, too. Oh, wait. Is this the dungeon?
[2:21:39] Woohoo. Okay, that's Renoir's draft. So, now we know where that is at least. Okay,
[2:21:45] that's that. All right, we should do this Serene's dress cuz that's the other side quest we got earlier. We didn't do it.
[2:21:52] So, we should do that. [Music]
[2:21:57] And then there's one more thing. This No, it's old Lumiere. It's just the exit. The back exit of Old Lumiere. Right. We've done Monokco Station. I'm
[2:22:03] pretty sure we did almost everything now. We're pretty much at the point where we have Serene's Dress, Sunless
[2:22:09] Cliffs, and then Endless Tower and Renoir's Drafts, and that's it, right?
[2:22:15] Okay. So, let's do Serene's dress first because that's a story based thing, too.
[2:22:26] Okay. Here we go.
[2:22:38] Where is it? Where's the entrance here? It's to my right.
[2:22:47] Uh, no. This is B. What?
[2:22:53] Here we go. I'm right on top of it. Oh, wow. It was
[2:23:00] hard to see. There's a vendor here.
[2:23:13] Serene. A serene outfit for CL. Oh, that's cool.
[2:23:30] See, we had put on all these different outfits over the course of the game, right? A different color scheme. Yeah, this is
[2:23:37] one of the coolest ones. That's just crazy looking. I really like the look of that outfit.
[2:23:44] Put on the new one for now. She also had one. She also has Serene
[2:23:51] with all the Serene outfits. Why doesn't he have a Serene outfit? Renoir outfit.
[2:24:00] That one's awesome.
[2:24:05] They're exactly the same. The only difference is that expedition has the arm on it.
[2:24:11] [Music] Got her in the Clay outfit. Okay, there
[2:24:16] you go. We have all different outfits now. P of Don, the stream is going pretty good. We We've already got some
[2:24:22] good stuff going. And here is Serene's dress. We're doing all the end game stuff. We're nearing the end now. Like,
[2:24:27] we only have uh very few things left to do in the game. So, we'll do this, then we'll do sunless cliffs, and then we'll
[2:24:32] check out the other stuff. The 46 are nearby.
[2:24:39] Here. Yeah, but getting to them might be tricky. When is it not?
[2:24:47] Yeah.
[2:25:00] The gate does not budge. According to Verso, past this door lies the trail of expedition 46. Lun's parents expedition.
[2:25:08] There's nothing around that would help open the door. Lun studies the door. Maybe she should try.
[2:25:13] Dancing a ballet. Now playing music.
[2:25:18] Luna summons her guitar. Her fingers hesitate. She closes her eyes and plays a song of longing.
[2:25:25] The door resonates to the music. Oh, this is total endgame stuff. Like, we already beat the story, but this is like
[2:25:32] optional act three content. Super challenging endgame stuff. So, yeah,
[2:25:37] definitely uh you know, watching today, you can still get enjoyment out of it, but you
[2:25:42] might not understand what the heck's going on. The valley dances to the sound of the strings. At the last haunting
[2:25:48] notes fade into silence, the gate opens. Oh, he turned into Lun. Okay.
[2:25:56] Are they my parents? No, it's Amily and Kristoff.
[2:26:03] They used to come by our house for dinner. You know what? I'm going to change the party. How do I get her so out of the party? I'll put Lun back in the party
[2:26:10] for now. And I was just going to say, let's equip the
[2:26:15] things that she doesn't have earned yet, like uh energizing.
[2:26:21] What the hell was it? Oh, wait. Monokco has it equipped, right?
[2:26:28] Mano has energy master.
[2:26:40] Like I don't even care what I give him.
[2:26:56] I don't know. Empowering Perry just to get out off of him. But now we have to equip that. So let's see.
[2:27:06] There we go. That should be enough, right? Wait now. Uh I still need more cuz I
[2:27:12] need I need uh 40.
[2:27:22] One more. One more point here. Okay. Energy master. There we go.
[2:27:30] Okay. So now I'm going to put that on her. So she didn't learn it yet.
[2:27:35] Energy master. Where is it? Where the hell is it? Energy master.
[2:27:43] There it is. And I'll give her Clay's life, too. I'll give her the two the two badass things
[2:27:49] we just learned. There you go.
[2:27:56] She have even more.
[2:28:06] Everything is energizing.
[2:28:13] Let's do that. Oh my god. I still have I still have more. I still have more to equip on her. I don't know what to put
[2:28:19] on her. Oh my goodness.
[2:28:26] Uh almost done.
[2:28:34] Sure. taken. Oh, I don't want her to take 50%
[2:28:40] more first. Oh, wait. First hit taken. I wonder if that counts as the
[2:28:46] here. We'll do this. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Jeez.
[2:28:51] They were good people. The journal must be around here.
[2:29:01] Okay. Gissando. Is it Gissando?
[2:29:07] Oh jeez. Oh [ __ ]
[2:29:13] Did they really have to do that? Legit jump scare. Thanks. Well, let's
[2:29:21] see what the heck this thing is. [Music]
[2:29:28] Attic glando.
[2:29:50] Okay,
[2:29:56] Harry. Oh, very nice blades sharp.
[2:30:01] [Music]
[2:30:08] Only 336. That's all. I'm
[2:30:14] [Music]
[2:30:21] lost. Now is our chance.
[2:30:28] Lightning. Oh, I forgot to give the the two turns. I messed up. I totally messed up. I
[2:30:34] forgot to give it a two turn ability. Oops. I got to do that.
[2:30:53] Wow. What the hell? There's another enemy.
[2:30:59] Who are you? Look at these guys. What are these?
[2:31:07] Oh, they dodge. Huh? [Music]
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:23] [Applause] [Music] So much for dizzy. Dizzy means you can't
[2:31:29] aim, but I'm doing it anyway. The joke's on you. I have an amazingly good game pad. [ __ ]
[2:31:37] So, they made him they made you dizzy so you couldn't aim. You had to kill them with a gun. That's funny. All right.
[2:31:43] Good stuff. [Music]
[2:31:52] Coralim. So, that's a new Is that a new uh equipment for her? Coralim. It is,
[2:31:57] isn't it? Let's see what it is. Critical chance when four stains are
[2:32:02] simultaneously active. 20% increased damage for each consecutive turn without taking damage. Can stack up to five
[2:32:08] times and critical hits will apply burn. That's not bad. That's not bad. Yeah,
[2:32:14] I'm not going to change it now, but that's not bad at all. All right. Um, I need to change this cuz
[2:32:19] I screwed up. We got to give her this the cheater, which is 40. So, let's take off anything that we
[2:32:26] don't need.
[2:32:43] Got it. Cheater. Now you got two turns. There you go. Okay.
[2:32:50] All right. So, we kicked that thing's butt there's going to be more. I guess. Oh, look. There's a lot. Is this what we're looking for?
[2:32:57] This might be it.
[2:33:03] I think these are her parents. Expedition 46. Analy
[2:33:09] Brezite finally succumbed to her infection. She fought off that blasted Nevon for 4 days and four nights, saving
[2:33:17] the rest of us. But it gashed her badly. Toward the end, she seemed almost
[2:33:22] peaceful. She said not to worry. Her daughter Looney will finish their work.
[2:33:28] Ah,
[2:33:34] you okay? Let's head back to camp. I guess we talked to her at camp to
[2:33:40] finish the the plot line. Yeah, look. That's cool. She went by herself to read that log. Oh, wow. Huh.
[2:33:49] All right. Well, that was quick. Basically just one boss fight.
[2:34:08] Okay,
[2:34:23] she's slow. Come on.
[2:34:33] As they arrive at camp, Verso sees that Lun has a lot on her mind.
[2:34:38] He invites her to talk away from the others.
[2:34:47] All my life, everything we did was about the Patress.
[2:34:53] It was a constant hum in the background. This worry, this responsibility,
[2:35:01] just always there. Always,
[2:35:07] always, always. There was no relief. Never. Even
[2:35:13] when I sleep, it's still there. Like a breath I can never release.
[2:35:19] That's a lot of pressure. Even her last words were still, "Finish
[2:35:24] our work. It also shows how much faith she had in you.
[2:35:30] That's one way to look at it. And the other way, my only value to them,
[2:35:37] not as a daughter, but as a backup plan for their legacy.
[2:35:43] You really believe that? They always said at the end of the game,
[2:35:48] there are no points for effort, only results. If you hate it so much,
[2:35:55] why continue their work at all? I don't know. Maybe because I still hear their voices
[2:36:01] in my head, and running away won't silence them. They're dead. The voices aren't theirs.
[2:36:09] They're yours. Even if they were alive, the voices in your head, the voices you
[2:36:14] listen to have to be your own. Is that how it works for you? Excuse me.
[2:36:24] Getting there. Sometimes it's hard to tell.
[2:36:29] Yeah. They share a commiserating smile. They understand each other. So, this is the
[2:36:37] final maxed out relationship. Oh, she's not maxed yet. We have to have one more conversation, I guess.
[2:36:44] Un impulsively kisses Verso on the cheek. Caught off guard, Verso smiles at her, a question in his eyes. laughing.
[2:36:49] They return to the others. So if I talk to her one more time, maybe we match that that plot line and
[2:36:56] relationship. Watching her. My she has the power to remake our world.
[2:37:02] Yeah, we already know this. Okay. All right. Yes, this will be it. This will go to the max relationship. Okay. Verso
[2:37:08] approaches Luna as she writes in her notebook.
[2:37:13] What are you writing this time? One notes on Neon. Nope.
[2:37:19] No theories on axons then or observations of flora and fauna.
[2:37:27] Keep guessing. Well, I saw you interview Monokco
[2:37:32] earlier. So, treaties on gestal behavior. Oh, so close.
[2:37:41] It's about me, isn't it? It's about me, isn't it? Uh, the strange and shattered life of Erso
[2:37:48] Dissant. That's a mouthful. Well,
[2:37:56] oh, really? Come on. You're smiling, so it must be good.
[2:38:01] Well, if you must know, I'm working on a song. A song?
[2:38:08] My parents said music was frivolous, but you know what? The voices we listen to
[2:38:14] have to be our own. And I've decided to be a little selfish with my time.
[2:38:20] Our problems will still be there in the morning. I fully support taking selfish breaks.
[2:38:26] Oh, I fully support taking selfish breaks. Oh, you do? Do you?
[2:38:33] Maybe we should take a selfish break together. Stay up with me tonight.
[2:38:38] Help me with my song.
[2:38:43] I'm surp I promised Monokco I would polish his negs. Uh, sorry. I promised Monokco I'd help
[2:38:51] him polish his negle. Of course. That is a twoman job.
[2:38:58] Wow. Despite her disappointment, Lun feels quite close to Verso. They're able to share with each other. She doesn't
[2:39:04] ask any more questions. What the hell? So, you weren't supposed to do that. They were supposed to pick the first
[2:39:11] option, which I didn't. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. They said they spend time composing
[2:39:16] music and they head back to camp. Se looked a bit disappointed that they came back so early. Luna better understands
[2:39:23] the world and herself. She got her max graded. So, everyone's maxed out now, right? Sky break.
[2:39:33] Everyone is maxed. Everyone has their highest level attacks now.
[2:39:39] Okay. All right. So, that's done. So, now
[2:39:46] we should do that sky, but we were just at the cliffs, sky cliffs or whatever it was. And then we have the choice after
[2:39:52] that. Do we want to do the endless tower or do we want to go to Renoir's draft? Either either one, I think, would be
[2:39:58] fine. So, where the heck was that? We were just at it.
[2:40:05] Was right here due south. Hang on tight. Hang on tight.
[2:40:16] I wonder what this is. Sunless cliffs. Danger.
[2:40:22] I'm at the end of the game in my level 80s. Danger. That's crazy.
[2:40:32] There's got to be a save point here.
[2:40:38] Debo is just gifted a sub. Thank you, Debo, for the gifted sub on kick. I
[2:40:44] appreciate that. Isn't that our only our second sub of the day? I think on kick. [Music]
[2:40:50] Dead end. There's nothing here.
[2:40:59] [Music] Okay.
[2:41:05] [Music] The hell's in here?
[2:41:14] All right. So, I don't know what we're going to find in here. It said danger, meaning it's going to be super tough, whatever it is. Oh,
[2:41:22] [Music] so Expedition 42 made it here, apparently. All right. All right. Well,
[2:41:27] Debo, thank you for the gifted sub. I appreciate that. Yes, you're our second gifted sub of the
[2:41:34] day. All right, so we'll split the part here and when we come back, we'll check out what the heck is in Sunless Cliffs
[2:41:40] and uh and then we will see what uh you know what else is left. There's not that much left from what I'm going to
[2:41:46] understand. Only like two other areas. So, all right, good stuff. See you in the next part.
[2:41:52] Okay, everybody. So, it is time for my uh break of the
[2:41:58] stream. This is my only break of the stream. After this, I'll be here for basically two and a half straight hours.
[2:42:03] Uh, thanks for chilling. For those who are here, oh, engaging and supporting. I appreciate you, man. I need a stretch,
[2:42:09] too. So, thanks for hanging out. I'll be back in about 10 minutes or so.
[2:42:14] And then we will have more awesome Clear Obscure Expedition 33 on the stream. In
[2:42:20] the meantime, I'm going to play you guys some highlight clips to enjoy while I'm gone. Now, if you could, if you're here
[2:42:26] and you're enjoying yourself, please support the stream. Right now, we're at 49 bucks of support. Obviously, with two
[2:42:31] and a half hours left, we could have a lot more progress than that. And like I said, this sadly is my least supported
[2:42:37] game right now, but I'm sticking to it because I like it so much and I want to see it through to the Simon fight like everyone's talking about. Please support
[2:42:44] the stream if you can. Anything appreciated. I'd like to do some shout outs when I get back and then we'll get back into the game. All right, in the
[2:42:49] meantime, enjoy these highlight clips, okay? And I'll be back shortly. It's Master
[2:42:56] Chief.

[2:55:41] My god, the Okay.
[2:55:50] Oh, Wings of Redemption is about to unfriend some people. Oh, how exciting. I can't wait to check that out later.
[2:55:56] All right. But anyway, anyway,
[2:56:03] here we go. Very exciting stuff. All right, I'm
[2:56:09] back. All right, no more interruptions. Maybe a maybe a pea break at some point, but I'm here for the rest of the stream.
[2:56:15] I got my coffee in hand. All right. M smells great, too. I can't wait to
[2:56:22] drink it, but it's too hot right now. And I'm ready to take on some of the hardest stuff in the game. Like everything left should be tough, right?
[2:56:28] That's what everyone is saying. Very good. How was our walk? Great. We
[2:56:33] had a great walk. We went and fed the neighborhood creatures. And uh Jasper
[2:56:38] Kitty was jealous and he jumped up on our table and started meowing cuz he wanted our attention. He's like, "How dare you go outside and give wild
[2:56:45] creatures attention instead of me?" That's how jealous uh Jasper Kitty is. So,
[2:56:52] and I made a coffee. Obviously, how do I take my coffee? I take it in a
[2:56:57] mug and war. War, you know, steaming steaming hot, piping hot in a mug.
[2:57:02] That's how I take it. See that? Okay.
[2:57:13] [Music]
[2:57:21] This is a complete lie. So, I'm just going to ban you now because you're an idiot. It's completely false. Okay.
[2:57:28] All right. Um, we're ready to start. And again, guys, like I said earlier, please
[2:57:33] support Expedition 33. I love Expedition 33. I'm going to see it to the end.
[2:57:39] We're going to play and hopefully get to Simon and take him out, but I need people to actually engage and support
[2:57:45] with the content. So, please, if you're here, please support the stream in some way. We got over two hours left on the
[2:57:51] stream. Let's go and let's get support for awesome RPGs. Here we go.
[2:58:00] Okay, I'm back. We're in the sun. We're in the sunless cliffs. And I have
[2:58:07] no idea where this goes. It says it's difficult. So, let's check it out and see what's through this door.
[2:58:14] Chromo moves inside the frame. Only one person may enter at a time.
[2:58:20] What
[2:58:26] mime? What the hell is this?
[2:58:33] Well, yes, I'd love a dance.
[2:58:41] partized.
[2:58:59] Foolish move.
[2:59:05] Of course I missed the last one. Uninvigorating.
[2:59:10] Oh, I'm muted. That's good. [Music]
[2:59:16] Now's my favorite part.
[2:59:28] Oh, really? [Music]
[2:59:36] Thank you, my dear. [Music]
[2:59:45] That's more like it. My favorite part.
[2:59:52] [Music] My lovely feet.
[3:00:12] I don't know why I can't time my parries right now at all. I mean, these are actually very easy to parry and I
[3:00:17] parried them a zillion times during the playthrough, but I can't parry it right now. I'm very, very sloppy.
[3:00:40] What to choose?
[3:00:47] I was doing good. No, I was screwing up all the parries. I was not doing good.
[3:01:00] That's more like it.
[3:01:06] Okay.
[3:01:18] I am refreshed.
[3:01:25] Get that stun out.
[3:01:33] See, I missed it again.
[3:01:39] I missed it again. Wow, I missed it again. My parries are so off today. So ridiculously off.
[3:01:51] [Music]
[3:02:03] Now I can stun him. I'd love a dance.
[3:02:15] All right. So, let's break him. Uh, dualist storm breaks. Right. That's
[3:02:21] what I want to do.
[3:02:32] Sweet. Mighty strike will do big damage when
[3:02:38] stunned and it br you to almighty mask.
[3:02:44] [Music]
[3:02:55] That'll do it. It massive stacked the attack and insta- killed him. The one
[3:03:02] max health is reduced to one. Why would I want that?
[3:03:07] I wonder. There must be a there must be something to it like a build where if you start at one health, the price is
[3:03:12] paid, the reward is served. The mime is conveyed as true art unreserved.
[3:03:18] New outfit unlocked from Monoko.
[3:03:27] What the? He's bald. He's bald. He has no hair. What the heck
[3:03:35] kind of hairdo is that? What the
[3:03:41] uh [Music] Okay, then he's bald. That's a
[3:03:48] disturbing outfit, but we're going to go go with it. All right, so we did it. Do we do Can we do the fight over with
[3:03:54] other people?
[3:04:06] And do we get different rewards?
[3:04:13] Let's try with my L.
[3:04:25] Let's dance. Already screwed up.
[3:04:32] Time to hit big. So the thing is I need to apply as much
[3:04:39] break as I can. [Music]
[3:04:51] [Music] Prepare for annihilation.
[3:05:00] Oh, that doesn't do it. That's like almost nothing.
[3:05:06] [Music] breaking roller. I see what brings up his break meter the most.
[3:05:12] Take down the shield. Nope. None of these do anything.
[3:05:22] Completely mistimed it. My timing is so off right now. It's ridiculous. Okay,
[3:05:29] dude. My I can't I don't know what's going on. I cannot parry right now. I'm playing incredibly poorly. I can't
[3:05:35] parry to save my life as you can see because I'm dead. Right. Let's try again
[3:05:41] [Music]
[3:05:50] on me.
[3:05:59] The parrying will fill his meter a ton.
[3:06:08] almost nothing. She basically has no moves that fill the meter. So, what I have to do is I have
[3:06:15] to keep doing what I just did and parry everything till this meter fills.
[3:06:28] See
[3:06:35] Okay,
[3:06:51] [Music] you [Music]
[3:07:00] Right. I never played Legend of Dragoon. No, I did not.
[3:07:08] [Music] Blades sharp.
[3:07:17] Finesse and precision.
[3:07:29] Okay,
[3:07:35] now we can break it. Blade sharp.
[3:07:49] Problem now is I cannot do Stendle.
[3:07:56] [Music] Now I can
[3:08:03] fire.
[3:08:26] Okay. Not looking good.
[3:08:32] [Music] Okay.
[3:08:49] Getting there. Not giving up
[3:08:59] on me.
[3:09:09] Time to hit B.
[3:09:21] Almost got the gradient attack up as well.
[3:09:28] Last chance. [Music]
[3:09:35] Right. I'll make it.
[3:09:45] Nice. Time to hit big.
[3:09:51] Finish him.
[3:09:57] Nicely done. Perfect parries. the entire time. Look at that. That freaking
[3:10:02] experience. All right, the muscade is true unreserved. She's bald.
[3:10:10] We're going to get everyone bald.
[3:10:18] Where is it? Perfect.
[3:10:24] The question is how many people can we actually beat him with? Not everyone. Like I think maybe Verso and that's it.
[3:10:30] Like I don't think we'll be able to beat him with anybody else. It's just going to be about perfect pairing, breaking, and then doing enough damage. But like I
[3:10:36] don't think Lun or CL could do enough damage in order to get
[3:10:42] like I think I could beat him with Verso, but that's it. Like Verso, if I do his uh maximum move at Srank, he'll
[3:10:50] do a lot of damage, but outside of that, there's I don't think I can beat him with anybody else. So, I basically beat
[3:10:57] him with the two characters who I could beat him with and we're bald now. So, there you go.
[3:11:03] Big Larry Gaming has tipped me two bucks says, "I tried the Dragon Quest 7 demo on the Switch 2 and PC. Seems like
[3:11:10] Switch 2 version runs best. The online testers have said the best performance is on Switch 2 and PS5. I love RPGs.
[3:11:16] Thank you for two bucks, Big Larry Gaming."
[3:11:21] That's, if you can believe it, that's our first tip of the day. No tips love for expedition 33, folks.
[3:11:30] None. No love at all for expedition 33.
[3:11:35] Very sad. We're at 51 bucks of support. Let's go.
[3:11:40] Let's rally and get some more support for expedition 33 right now.
[3:11:47] That's good coffee. I'm going to try one more time with Versel. All right.
[3:11:53] I don't think I can beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat him with lune or cl. I don't think they're good enough.
[3:12:00] I'm going to try it with Versel.
[3:12:10] Just try it.
[3:12:23] My turn.
[3:12:32] No stun. [Music]
[3:12:52] Time to end this. Prepare for oblivion. Might have.
[3:13:03] [Music] Oh well.
[3:13:15] [Music]
[3:13:23] You break him now. Let's have some fun. [Music]
[3:13:32] Radiant awaits
[3:13:38] and reapply stun. End of the line.
[3:13:43] [Music] Look at that.
[3:13:55] Oops. Strong tank. [Music]
[3:14:01] Reapply stun again. Do that damage, baby.
[3:14:11] Say he's no longer stunned. Even though it's supposed to supposed to reapply stunt didn't work,
[3:14:18] but he's dead. See, that was easy. That was easy with Verso.
[3:14:25] The reward served. Bald Verso. Now,
[3:14:30] now we're in the end game. You understand? We've done it.
[3:14:37] If only we could have a whole team of Baldies, but I just don't see us doing the damage output with Lun and CL needed
[3:14:45] in order to actually beat this guy. Like, I just don't see it happening, which really sucks, obviously.
[3:14:56] Let's see. What is it? Energizing. No, it's up here, right? Energy.
[3:15:04] [Music] Energy master. Yep.
[3:15:20] Clay's life. I don't know what the one is for. So, I have a picto let you start with one HP, but I'm not sure what that's going to do. Oh, it's already
[3:15:28] equipped. Oh. [Music]
[3:15:38] I just don't think I'm going to do enough damage with her to kill to kill. I could try, but I don't think so.
[3:15:48] I'll try, but I don't think it's going to work. Actually, does Luna even have a move that breaks? I don't think she
[3:15:54] does. Does she?
[3:16:00] No. Oh, see if she without a move that breaks, she can't even beat him. She has to break.
[3:16:08] So here, instead of stormaller, we have to get a move that will break.
[3:16:19] She literally doesn't have a move that breaks. Can I learn a move that breaks?
[3:16:26] Here
[3:16:43] we go. Can break if four stains are consumed. [Music]
[3:16:50] Can break. Rock slide. break damage for five hits. Ooh, these
[3:16:57] are actually good.
[3:17:04] Increases all break damage received by 50%. So, this is like right near that's like
[3:17:09] the anti mime build right there. And I just hadn't unlocked it yet. Okay,
[3:17:20] so for her, we want to get rid of certain things. We want to get rid of stormaller.
[3:17:28] [Music] Low earth damage and break damage to all enemies every turn. Increases break
[3:17:35] damage received by 50%. Duration of three turns.
[3:17:44] What was the other one? Earth rising. No, there it is. Crystal crush.
[3:17:49] [Music]
[3:17:58] rid of Ice Lance. And for now, get rid of Rebirth cuz she
[3:18:04] can't he she can't revive. There you go. We just do all break damage moves and see what happens. I'm
[3:18:10] probably not going to be able to beat him, though. But we'll find out. Let's try. Seal already has a move that breaks,
[3:18:16] right? Can break. Yeah, final path breaks.
[3:18:22] So, final path breaks. Okay, let's see what happens here. I don't
[3:18:28] think we're going to be able to beat it, though. But we'll try. Okay,
[3:18:45] let's try it. Kevin, how are you?
[3:19:09] [Music]
[3:19:17] Now is our choice. So, let's see. [Music]
[3:19:25] Higher Earth than break damage for five hits. Okay.
[3:19:32] Break damage to all enemies every turn.
[3:19:43] It did like nothing. It seriously did nothing. What a waste.
[3:19:49] [Music]
[3:19:54] I'm ready.
[3:19:59] Yes, this is endgame content. We already finished the main story back in June. This is endgame stuff.
[3:20:09] This is the toughest mime in the game. I'll do it.
[3:20:18] Well, I screwed up. Not good.
[3:20:26] [Music]
[3:20:31] Feeling better.
[3:20:37] [Music] Oh, that did tons of brain damage this
[3:20:44] time. Nice. That was great.
[3:20:56] I'll do it. Yo,
[3:21:04] the elements dance.
[3:21:11] [Music]
[3:21:18] Chroma is flowing. [Music]
[3:21:28] Toughness of earth. I'll do it.
[3:21:49] Almost got him stunned. [Music]
[3:22:01] Better. Okay. Oh, it's not really Kevin. It's a fake one. Okay. What's up, King Michael?
[3:22:07] How are you today? All right, we can break him right now.
[3:22:16] Feeling better.
[3:22:30] Okay, lightning.
[3:22:36] Problem is I can't really hurt him. That's what sucks.
[3:22:44] [Music]
[3:22:58] [Music] All right, let's try hell.
[3:23:04] Pretty good.
[3:23:09] I'm ready.
[3:23:15] Very good. What do you mean all this for a bald skin? It's totally worth it.
[3:23:25] I'm going to have a whole team of baldies. God damn it. This I demand.
[3:23:32] Extreme
[3:23:43] damage to all enemies. One hit element depends on which stain Luna has the most. Okay, let's try it. Sky break. I
[3:23:49] want to see what it what happens.
[3:23:55] Doors of Chroma open. Pretty good.
[3:24:02] I'll do it.
[3:24:12] Ready to evade.
[3:24:30] D. We're getting there. What are those? Universal stains. Holy
[3:24:36] crap. Look at those. Yeah, look. Everything is buffed.
[3:24:42] [Music]
[3:24:49] Feeling better.
[3:25:08] I'm ready.
[3:25:17] Overflowing with energy.
[3:25:34] [Music]
[3:25:43] Genius, but we're getting it done. I don't know. I think CL is going to be the most ridiculously hard one to do.
[3:26:04] [Music] So much potential.
[3:26:10] Lightning.
[3:26:17] Almost dead. [Music]
[3:26:32] The thing if you're going to parry, there's no way you can lose to the mine. It's just it's a war of attrition. I'm ready.
[3:26:45] [Music]
[3:26:53] Killed him with the counter. There we go.
[3:26:59] [Music] Well, we got our true reward. There it
[3:27:06] is.
[3:27:12] Very nice. But now the true challenge is trying to do this with CL. She's the
[3:27:18] lowest level of anyone. She doesn't really have a very great build. I don't even really know how to play with this
[3:27:24] build she has. So I don't know about this. I don't know how I'm not feeling too confident about winning with CL to
[3:27:31] be honest. The thing is I want a whole party of eggghheads. I want them to all shine like a bunch of Q balls, but I
[3:27:38] don't know if I can do it. What do you guys think? What do you mean the bald look is awful?
[3:27:44] How dare you say that? King Matt, how are you today? Good to see you. Come on, let's rally here so that I can beat
[3:27:54] the final mime with CL and get five baldies.
[3:28:02] Here we go. We're going to go fight him just like this. Five baldies.
[3:28:12] We're going to try. I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it with CL. I think it's going to be too difficult.
[3:28:18] Can you have a badge deal? No, because you never ever are serious about it. You ask every time and then you never do it.
[3:28:24] So, no, you may never have a badge deal. Okay.
[3:28:29] Oh, I fight Simon. We're coming up to it. This is the second to last thing and we have uh two two things left to do in
[3:28:35] the game. Try me.
[3:28:45] Try me.
[3:28:55] Not today.
[3:29:04] Full deck. So, let's see here. Here's
[3:29:11] [Music] your card. Try me.
[3:29:17] [Music]
[3:29:33] No, Dark Side Philill is not a Star Wars reference at all in any way.
[3:29:40] [Music]
[3:29:49] I currently have five. How high does it go? I don't know how high Forel goes.
[3:29:57] [Music]
[3:30:02] Take your shot.
[3:30:09] Can I call my viewers darksiders? No. Absolutely not.
[3:30:21] [Music]
[3:30:41] Well, well, it's taking too long.
[3:30:49] [Music]
[3:30:56] I'll try Dark Wade. Death's a friend.
[3:31:02] A tiny bit of break.
[3:31:11] Take your shot.
[3:31:21] [Music]
[3:31:30] Let's gambling.
[3:31:38] I'm in Twilight now. Twilight dance
[3:31:45] stars touch.
[3:31:51] Wow. I did like nothing.
[3:31:58] By the way, I screwed up. I don't have I don't have cheater equipped to her. I don't have the double turn. That's
[3:32:03] what's going on here.
[3:32:08] I completely screwed up. If I don't have cheater equipped number yet.
[3:32:17] I also don't have the shield equipped. I have nothing equipped to her apparently. [Music]
[3:32:25] Yeah, I don't have the shield, nor do I have the double turn, so I'm really screwed up in this fight. I I didn't
[3:32:30] have her ready at all. Jeez.
[3:32:36] Take your shot.
[3:32:45] [Music]
[3:32:56] [Music] Take your shot.
[3:33:12] Oh, nothing works.
[3:33:19] I I needed two turns here. I screwed it up.
[3:33:24] At least if I had two turns, I'd be putting seven uh seven to at least four forell every turn. But I screwed this up
[3:33:31] entirely. I thought I had it equipped to her, but
[3:33:37] I don't. I have like nothing equipped to her at all. Sucks.
[3:33:48] Take your shots.
[3:33:58] Let's play. Here's your card.
[3:34:11] Will I fight Simon today? Depends on how long the dungeon is. I don't know how long it is.
[3:34:22] Well, I can break him now.
[3:34:33] Let's gamble. [Music]
[3:34:46] Not today.
[3:35:04] Let's gamble. [Music]
[3:35:19] Uh h
[3:35:26] [Music]
[3:35:32] Nothing. Wow.
[3:35:48] Like I can kill him. It's going to take forever though. sucked today.
[3:36:01] Full deck. [Music]
[3:36:12] Death. It's a friend.
[3:36:17] [Music]
[3:36:26] [Music]
[3:36:36] Take your shots.
[3:36:44] [Music]
[3:36:57] Two turns left of Twilight.
[3:37:30] Okay. Whole deck.
[3:37:37] Extend twilight duration by one turn. The stars judged you.
[3:37:59] Getting there. I'm waiting.
[3:38:15] Okay. Almost
[3:38:28] [Music] end slice. Extreme target physical damage one hit damage increase for each
[3:38:35] forell consumed since the beginning of battle.
[3:38:44] Wow. I wiped him. I did it. I beat it with
[3:38:49] everyone. End slice ended the mine.
[3:38:58] All right. Done and done. The mime convey his true art unserved. There it is. We got a
[3:39:05] whole team of Baldies. Let's go. Come on. Let's celebrate.
[3:39:14] Let's get a celebration for the Baldi team.
[3:39:20] Look at that. I got to change our outfits now. Let's see.
[3:39:34] Oh, we never got her baguette outfit. Damn it.
[3:40:02] [Music] All right, those are our endgame outfits now for the rest of the game. But Luna
[3:40:09] now is all screwed up. We screwed up her whole build. Yeah, we did. She has all the wrong moves. Like I
[3:40:15] don't want these rock slide moves. Then again, I also don't want ice lance. Like a lot of these I don't want. Maybe
[3:40:21] I do want this lightning dance, healing light, hell. Which one wasn't I using?
[3:40:27] Rock slide. Terraquake. Terraquake sucks.
[3:40:34] Everything else is fine. We'll keep everything else. There you go.
[3:40:39] Okay, we've done it. The ultimate challenge completed.
[3:40:45] Team Baldi's.
[3:40:51] All right. So, should I do Endless Tower or should I go to uh should I go to Renoir's Draft? I
[3:40:59] mean, Renoir's draft is Simon, but I guess you guys are saying that the tower is easier than than Simon, so I should
[3:41:05] do the tower first, right? [Music]
[3:41:23] Does being bald help? Yeah, it's actually kind of aerodynamic if you're like you can move a little faster
[3:41:28] because your hair isn't catching the wind.
[3:41:36] Also, I'm sure it's pretty easy to do your hair every day.
[3:41:41] So, where is that challenge tower? It's over here, right? Endless tower.
[3:41:47] do Renoir's drafts. Well, the thing is I'm being told that the endless tower should be first because that's it's easier. Like Renoir's drafts is the
[3:41:54] hardest thing in the game. It's supposed to be, you know, at least assignment. So, I should do this first.
[3:42:01] What's up, Queen Mike? [Music] Did I hear of a band called Eigor? No,
[3:42:07] I've never heard of that.
[3:42:14] Please unban Buckwell. You can't get a badge deal because you've never contributed. So, I don't believe you. So, you get no badge deal whatsoever.
[3:42:20] Ever under any circumstance. Hang on tight.
[3:42:26] [Music] Where's the entrance?
[3:42:34] [Music]
[3:42:40] Okay. Endless tower. Don't do the DLC bosses. I don't even
[3:42:46] know what the DLC bosses are. So,
[3:42:52] just tell me how to avoid the DLC bosses. I guess that's where she used to paint and create.
[3:43:01] Okay. Yeah. A proper challenge.
[3:43:11] A proper challenge. Ew. How prop up?
[3:43:24] What's this? See, what are the DLC bosses? Go up top to the paintings. These
[3:43:30] paintings here. Am I fighting those paintings or am I going up there? What am I doing?
[3:43:41] That's one. This is a DLC boss, so don't fight this one.
[3:43:48] Yes, fight the paintings now. I'm being told. So, do fight the paintings. So, fight these. Fight this one.
[3:44:02] Duolies.
[3:44:20] Ow. Ready to carry.
[3:44:37] I thought
[3:44:59] I believe
[3:45:05] [Music] I'm back. Watch out. Mano.
[3:45:22] Ah.
[3:45:27] [Music]
[3:45:37] What heavy feet?
[3:45:54] Your turn to shine. [Music]
[3:46:01] Heat. Heat.
[3:46:33] This was a DLC boss. Okay. Yeah, I was going to say there's no way. How am I going to beat this? I have to parry
[3:46:38] endlessly. This has got to be a DLC boss. So, I was not supposed to fight that boss, I'm being told.
[3:46:53] So, I'm assuming the one on the other side is also way too tough. I guess we were supposed to go up here,
[3:47:03] right? This two is probably a DLC boss.
[3:47:11] I just want to see it. I just want to see it.
[3:47:21] Danger. It's clanting too.
[3:47:30] [Music] I'll make
[3:47:47] I should have just said abandon battle, but I said return to desktop. Okay,
[3:47:53] so that was insane. I just fought Clea and beat her. That's a a worse version of Clea. Good lord.
[3:48:04] Handtapping Darren. How are you?
[3:48:12] Yes, that was a very close fight. Very close.
[3:48:18] Go downstairs and talk to Cla. Oh, so all that was DLC. I was supposed to do it. Oh,
[3:48:28] okay.
[3:48:40] I didn't see anyone downstairs.
[3:48:45] Oh, she's right here. How did I miss this?
[3:48:50] Wait a minute. This wasn't here when I came in, was it?
[3:48:58] Lisia, I must say you've surprised me. I didn't expect you and your friends to succeed. I certainly didn't expect the
[3:49:03] doppelganger to put you in his schemes. He was supposed to keep an eye on you, not recruit you. You did well. All it is
[3:49:09] for when water to clean up the canvas. How can you let him erase Verso's
[3:49:14] canvas? Alicia, don't be emotional. You know this is necessity.
[3:49:21] And spare me that dril of how much this canvas means to you. I spent far more time here than you. I painted half this
[3:49:26] world with Verso. We went on adventures here while you sat reading in your room. I was perfectly fine leaving my man here
[3:49:32] to work out her sorrows. If you insist on staying, well, that's your choice. Renoir will not stand for it, and I need
[3:49:38] him to help me with the real conflict outside, not waste more of his time in here. Enough. I grow tired of repeating
[3:49:44] myself. Renoir will do what he needs to be done. Why don't we have some fun instead? Sure. I'll show you what you
[3:49:49] missed out on those years hiding in your room. A game Vers and I used to play. I sketch figures, doodles. Your friends
[3:49:55] called them neons. creative game. First one I named the challenge the gauntlet. Survived them. I'll show you the true
[3:50:00] drawing. Okay.
[3:50:06] The gauntlet. So, I guess we're going to see what this is.
[3:50:11] [Music]
[3:50:17] Okay. All right. Ready?
[3:50:27] [Music]
[3:50:36] Wow.
[3:50:47] Okay. habit
[3:50:54] [Music]
[3:50:59] of violence. Yes.
[3:51:23] Finesse and gracef
[3:51:38] its allies. It has no allies.
[3:51:54] Okay then.
[3:51:59] Uhoh. Oh, the game did the audio glitch. Now this happened the other day, too. So now there's no audio. We have to We have
[3:52:06] to close the game and reopen it to get the audio back. This just happened the other day. It only happens with this
[3:52:11] game. I don't know what causes it, but Oh, I can't even rest. The game just
[3:52:17] froze. Look. Whoa. The game just closed. What just happened? What the hell is this?
[3:52:22] What is this? Uh, what am I looking at?
[3:52:30] Uh, why is this here?
[3:52:38] What the? Now we're back. Huh?
[3:52:44] Now we're back and the audio is back.
[3:52:52] Sure. Okay, let's play again. [Music]
[3:52:59] There's 11 stages multiplied by three.
[3:53:07] My what lovely feet.
[3:53:17] energized.
[3:53:29] Take cover.
[3:53:56] Stop. Goodbye.
[3:54:05] [Music] A storm is coming.
[3:54:16] Lightning dark.
[3:54:21] [Music]
[3:54:32] energized. Here we go.
[3:54:39] Giant damage. Stacking that damage. Yes. It's not what I wanted. I wanted
[3:54:45] this. Thank you. [Music]
[3:54:52] Very nice. Careful now.
[3:54:57] [Music] Perfect parry. This will hurt.
[3:55:06] [Music]
[3:55:19] Wow.
[3:55:28] Say goodbye, [ __ ]
[3:55:34] A I can't kill him. I don't have enough. Look, I don't have enough to kill him this
[3:55:40] turn. I have to parry one more time. That sucks.
[3:55:46] Let's start.
[3:55:52] Well, yes, I'd love a dance.
[3:56:05] Can I kill him with this? Yes. Beautiful gradient counter finish.
[3:56:12] We got greater defenseless 15% to defenseless damage amplification. Okay.
[3:56:20] Am I ever going to play My Friendly Neighborhood again? I might. I I actually really liked it. I liked My
[3:56:26] Friendly Neighborhood um that first time we played it, we just never got back to it. And people weren't
[3:56:32] really in the mood for I guess uh more horror stuff after like October,
[3:56:38] right? Like we really didn't do much else after that. We just finished up what we stuff we were already playing,
[3:56:46] but I'd be down to go back to it at some point if people wanted it. Okay, my nose is itching.
[3:56:55] Oh, let's see. I received an anonymous $3.36
[3:57:02] tip. 336. Okay. Well, thank you, whoever that was. I appreciate that.
[3:57:08] That was the first contribution that we received in over an hour. So, I appreciate that very much as I'm doing
[3:57:14] the ultra challenging endgame content here of Expedition 33. Thank you for that support. We've got about an hour
[3:57:21] and 15 minutes left on the stream and there's not much left in the game. We've got this tower we're doing right now and
[3:57:28] a final boss of this tower which is the second hardest boss in the game real the base game. And then after this, we've
[3:57:33] got Renoir's drafts dungeon and then Simon and that's it. We've done everything besides DLC content. So, uh,
[3:57:39] let's see how it goes. I think this is a good place to split the part. Thank you for watching and, uh,
[3:57:47] hopefully in the next part we'll focus on this. Maybe we'll beat the tower today. We'll see. All right. See you then.
[3:57:53] Okay. All right. I just want to stretch my legs here for a second. Okay.
[3:58:01] [Music] Let's see here. Loves to spoo. Says, you know, I came here from kick. I couldn't
[3:58:06] talk over there. It's too awful. Yeah, I know they're spamming right now. Now, they already know that I said that I'm going to ban them if they spam emotes
[3:58:13] and they're doing it. So, I wonder if that means they just want me to ban them. Do you think that's what it means? They want me to ban them all?
[3:58:20] What do you think? What does everyone think? Should I ban the spammers cuz it's against the rules and they know it?
[3:58:37] Well, they're still spamming, so I guess that's that. I was trying to give them a chance, but I, you know, I'm not going to just let them do it the entire
[3:58:44] stream. So, say goodbye. Get rid of all these idiots. Go.
[3:58:50] Every single one is a brand new sock account, too, which is hilarious. Okay. Excuse me.
[3:58:58] There's what? 10 of them. 10 of these sock counts. Nine.
[3:59:05] There's 10.
[3:59:12] 11. Okay. 11 socks. 11 11 socks dead. Now they could stop
[3:59:18] spamming. Uh, sweet angel inertia. Sweet Angel Inertia asks you
[3:59:25] that you made all the characters bald. Any particular strange bald person? You know, I had a teacher at school who was bald and very tall. No, not really.
[3:59:32] Don't know anyone weird who's bald. Okay.
[3:59:39] You made a depiction of me in Elden Ring. I'm sure it's flattering. Thanks for that. Uh, spot.
[3:59:45] Okay. Um, so real quick, I'm going to pee. Then
[3:59:52] we're going to come back. We're going to focus on this tower. See how far we can get today. I'm assuming one to two more streams will probably end up doing
[3:59:58] everything, right? Um, all right. I'll be right back. I'm just going to leave it here. Now, guys, when I come back, we've got a little over an hour left.
[4:00:04] Please, if you can, please support the stream. All right. Like I said, I really
[4:00:09] don't want Expedition 33 Endgame to be the unsupported content. Sadly, it's
[4:00:15] it's turned into exactly how it was when I was beating the main game. Anything would be appreciated. Seriously. Okay.
[4:00:21] All right. I'll be right back.
[4:00:36] [Music]
[4:01:48] I will talk with all of you and shout out stuff between these rounds of the endless tower. Okay,
[4:01:56] that is if anything even, you know, comes in to be shouted out cuz again, it's been a dead stream. All the support, like, no, no lie, 40 bucks of
[4:02:03] support came in before I started playing. All right, let's go.
[4:02:10] All righty, folks. Let's continue. We're in the endless tower. Let's keep going.
[4:02:16] We're now in stage two. So, you guys said there was 11 stages with three challenges each. Okay.
[4:02:24] My what lovely meat.
[4:02:30] Excuse me. Energized.
[4:02:38] [Music] The annoying part is you see what they're doing. They're putting in parties you can't just kill all at once.
[4:02:45] It's impossible. Finesse and grace.
[4:02:51] [Music]
[4:03:06] [Music] Oh, I forgot to press A.
[4:03:17] Goodbye.
[4:03:23] Very good. Very good.
[4:03:32] Okay. [Music]
[4:03:37] Someone took a dollar and said, "I've only seen your content on other channels. Really not as bad as they make
[4:03:43] it look. I found out at the $3 I can't add my name on PayPal, but no problem.
[4:03:52] There is no way to add your name if you're doing a PayPal tip. What you do is you put what you want to be called in the body of the tip. There's no section
[4:03:58] on PayPal to enter a name. That's actually correct. So, if you are interested in tipping me, just say, "Hey, it's so and so and I just wanted
[4:04:05] to say blah blah blah." And I'll just read it out like that. Okay. Thank you for the dollar. Are you the person who also tipped the $3 earlier? I think
[4:04:11] that's what they're saying is they tipped the three earlier and didn't realize there was no way to put in any information there. Right. Okay. Hey,
[4:04:16] thank you for the buck and I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying and uh you know
[4:04:23] you're you're seeing at face value the kind of content that I put out. Really, I appreciate that. I do. Thank you.
[4:04:29] Okay, trial two.
[4:04:37] I would love feet.
[4:04:44] Lovely feet.
[4:04:51] Wow. [Music]
[4:05:10] energized.
[4:05:16] Let's spill some tea.
[4:05:23] Did it Did it break the shield? No. Yes, it still broke the shield. Oh,
[4:05:29] that's cool. That's all I wanted to do is break the shield and it works. Take down the shield.
[4:05:34] I don't care that they dodge as long as the shield removes. It likes you.
[4:05:44] Careful of my
[4:05:52] Now's our chance.
[4:06:03] Ed, I'm glad to hear that. King Mass says
[4:06:09] he's been watching Tormented Souls on demand. He's loving the playthrough because he loves puzzle games. One or two? Cuz I've played both. Well, I got
[4:06:15] both in the in the the uh playlist there. So, give them a look. But yeah, both were great games.
[4:06:23] Okay. All right. So, this will be a boss fight. I guess the third stage is always
[4:06:29] a boss. Yep. I'm ready. [Music]
[4:06:42] Your turn. Dance
[4:06:51] power. [Music]
[4:06:56] Cool.
[4:07:03] [Music]
[4:07:09] Killed that guy on the side. [Music]
[4:07:20] Defenseless. No.
[4:07:27] Okay, [Music]
[4:07:37] now it's our choice. [Music]
[4:07:46] [Applause] Okay. [Music]
[4:07:57] Okay.
[4:08:02] No.
[4:08:08] Your turn to shine. It likes you.
[4:08:15] Come on. Negative violence. Yes. It faded away. That's amazing.
[4:08:24] [Music] Finale. Energizing rush. Give 2 AP on applying
[4:08:31] rush. Do you want to know the truth? I don't know what rush is. I mean, act three, end game like like 50
[4:08:38] 60 hours into the playthrough. I don't know what rush is. I have no clue. All right,
[4:08:44] so trial two done. There's still a lot more to go, though. If you beat this boss, you're ready for
[4:08:49] the DLC version. Oh, I beat that boss easily. Unless you're talking about the end boss of this. Rush is like haste.
[4:08:56] Oh, okay. Okay. I received a dollar2 tip and
[4:09:02] that's it. There's no message attached to it, but it's a$112. So, thank you whoever that was. I appreciate that.
[4:09:17] Okay. I don't like that I have to go all the way down to select these. This sucks. It
[4:09:24] take 100 years to select this in the menu.
[4:09:32] Damn it. It's cool. They got the music on the different stages.
[4:09:46] violence.
[4:09:54] Can't really do much now. I do oral and cheers above everybody else. There we go.
[4:10:08] Nice. A rousing insta kill.
[4:10:15] [Music] Last chance.
[4:10:35] Chron's flowing. [Music]
[4:10:49] One one hit. Done. Dead.
[4:10:56] Okay.
[4:11:03] Venure. Danger.
[4:11:12] Okay, your time to show
[4:11:18] that. I'm muted. Great.
[4:11:27] You're still muted. Great. [Music] on
[4:11:35] fiery
[4:11:41] I'm ready [Music]
[4:11:53] up your chance
[4:12:00] Beautiful.
[4:12:06] Oh, they're doing like some big buffs. Your turn to shine.
[4:12:21] [Music]
[4:12:26] [Applause] Nope.
[4:12:34] Look at this shield they got. Damn, they got crazy shields right now.
[4:12:50] [Music]
[4:13:00] Let's keep going.
[4:13:05] Go.
[4:13:10] [Music]
[4:13:18] Nope.
[4:13:24] [Music] What to choose? I'm still muted. Jeez.
[4:13:46] Violence
[4:13:54] blades shine. [Music]
[4:14:07] That's exactly what I wanted.
[4:14:22] Damn it. Couldn't kill him.
[4:14:29] I'm ready. Oh, yes. Good night.
[4:14:39] Time to bleed. [Music]
[4:14:54] counterattach that. Nicely done.
[4:15:01] Jeez, all these experience points I'm getting.
[4:15:15] Okay, keep going. You hate turn-based games, but you love seeing them. Uh, there's I'm sure
[4:15:21] there's some things that some people hate playing, but enjoy watching. I can understand that. I think I think that
[4:15:27] could make some sense.
[4:15:39] Huh? Wait. Huh? I beat them all.
[4:15:45] Uh,
[4:15:54] I already I don't understand. I beat them all. It won't continue.
[4:16:07] Uh,
[4:16:14] it's all good. Someone said, "Sorry for the weird tipping. I'm bad at PayPal." It's all good. Don't worry about it. I said, "When you tip, just put whatever
[4:16:19] you want to say your name and everything in the body of the message." I don't understand. Did I do them all?
[4:16:26] I'm so confused.
[4:16:32] Oh, no. Oh, we didn't do this one yet. Okay. To evade.
[4:16:38] Oh, it's the sheep. Remember the sheep.
[4:16:55] Annoying. So much power.
[4:17:03] killed the idiot with the shield.
[4:17:11] Time to hit.
[4:17:19] Prepare for annihilation.
[4:17:27] Great music. Last chance.
[4:17:36] I missed the third one. [ __ ] Ready to carry me.
[4:17:46] Get off me. The elephant's dance.
[4:17:59] Chroma is good.
[4:18:10] That was good. Did tons of damage.
[4:18:17] Your turn to dance.
[4:18:24] Missed it. [ __ ] Wow.
[4:18:34] Very nice. What lovely freeze. Cannot break. [ __ ] All right. Just do
[4:18:40] lamp blaster. Land master again.
[4:18:56] [Music]
[4:19:05] Meert violence. Yes.
[4:19:16] What a lovely feat. [Music]
[4:19:22] We go. Nice damage. Woo!
[4:19:29] Cleo. We got a Clea hairstyle. Oh, we got a new hairstyle unlocked. That's
[4:19:35] cool.
[4:19:41] Anokco leveled up. That's Noe. Moperte is no ferte. Well,
[4:19:48] too bad. Wait a minute. It's not for her. Who the
[4:19:56] hell is it for?
[4:20:03] It's for Lun. That's weird. Yeah, look. CLA's hairstyle on Lun.
[4:20:08] Well, now we got to go back to bald. Sorry. I worked hard to earn these bald hairstyles. We better get some baldness
[4:20:14] going here. All right, we're on stage four. This is going to take forever, man. There's 11
[4:20:21] of these damn things.
[4:20:36] [Music] Oh, don't want to violence. Yes.
[4:20:53] Finesse and grace.
[4:21:03] Nice insta kill.
[4:21:10] Last chance. Storm is coming.
[4:21:19] Try Crystal Crush. See what it does. Let's shake the earth.
[4:21:25] Not bad at all. And insanely high break. That's awesome.
[4:21:30] And now she can break. Yeah. Quake in. Wow. This build is better than her old
[4:21:36] build. It really is. Energized.
[4:21:42] Time to bleed.
[4:21:48] [Music] Almost dead. Look at that. Okay,
[4:21:55] say goodbye. Nicely done.
[4:22:02] DSP tries it. Applesauce. I like applesauce, but I haven't had it in a very long time. Yeah.
[4:22:09] Okay.
[4:22:15] I don't know. Okay.
[4:22:25] All right.
[4:22:38] You guys are trolling, huh? Yeah, people are trolling. They're being stupid. Hold on. I'm just going to double check, but
[4:22:43] I'm pretty sure people are trolling right now.
[4:22:49] Yep, they're trolling.
[4:22:56] So, I guess I'll just ban both of you guys.
[4:23:04] Okay. I just got a $5 anonymous tip. says, "Uh, I want to thank you. You're
[4:23:10] trying to clean up Kick. A ton of friends and I came over from Asmin Gold, but we can't handle the constant toxicity and harassment over there
[4:23:16] trying to be normal chatters. Hopefully, it'll change soon." To be honest, that's how Kick Chat has always been. It's much
[4:23:22] more manageable to control YouTube chat than Kick. Kick is kind of hard to do anything with, even with the bots and
[4:23:28] everything that we have. So, if you want to chat as an active positive supporter, I strongly recommend that you go to
[4:23:35] YouTube, okay?
[4:23:41] Strongly recommend that you go to YouTube and talk on YouTube. [Music]
[4:23:49] And thanks to those who do. I mean, listen, I understand that there's people on both sides who are positive uh chatters,
[4:23:56] and that's cool. I like that. I like that there are people who like the content and will watch no matter where they are. It's just, you're right, on
[4:24:02] kick, it's kind of uncontrollable. They could come back with sock accounts easily and just do stupid stuff. And it
[4:24:07] is what it is. Like my mods do the do the their best, the the bots do their best, but it's not really fully
[4:24:12] controllable, which is unfortunate, obviously.
[4:24:22] Lovely. Huh? Here
[4:24:30] we go. Thank you for the $5, whoever the
[4:24:35] anonymous tipper was. I appreciate that very much.
[4:24:55] [Music] Take down that shield.
[4:25:01] That was the wrong attack. Darn it. That doesn't break. I thought that was going to break her. I did the wrong one. Ah, I
[4:25:07] stink. Take cover.
[4:25:23] Now's our chance.
[4:25:33] Very nice.
[4:25:40] Time to bleed. Time to break. There it is. can break. Thous
[4:25:54] spit out my L, you dick.
[4:26:01] Oh, there's 33 challenges in the tower, hence expedition 33. Get it? That's why the tower has 33. Cool. Thanks, Kane. I
[4:26:08] didn't understand that. Someone had said there was uh 11 levels of three. Okay, cool.
[4:26:18] of your defeat.
[4:26:27] I'm ready. I'm firing.
[4:26:34] Very nice. [Music]
[4:26:42] Okay, we got one more to go for four. But man, this is going to take I don't think we're going to finish this today.
[4:26:47] It's a long challenge tower, but we're getting it done on me.
[4:27:03] Well, I got blinded.
[4:27:26] Okay, I'm ready. Let's start.
[4:27:32] I like that they call them thunder thingies. Like the game doesn't even know what they are.
[4:27:39] A [ __ ] Screwed up.
[4:27:49] [Music]
[4:28:02] Crystal crush. High brake damage. Let's do that. Let's shake the earth.
[4:28:09] It really wasn't that high break damage, honestly. I wish it was.
[4:28:20] Okay. Oh, I didn't do it. Darn. I didn't do
[4:28:27] it. My fault.
[4:28:33] [Music]
[4:28:47] Decent. Not giving up. I wonder if I'm supposed to shoot that little thing.
[4:28:55] Maybe. I'm not sure. Oh no, I forgot to Ah, I didn't give myself enough for last
[4:29:01] chance cuz I'm a [ __ ] Watch out. [Music]
[4:29:22] [Music] My love.
[4:29:34] Okay, now he can be stunned. I'm not giving up.
[4:29:41] [Music]
[4:29:48] We go blazing.
[4:29:54] [Music]
[4:30:02] [Music] The storm is coming.
[4:30:08] [Music] Rock slide can break. Here we go.
[4:30:20] Oh, you know what? Let's do this. Let's do sky break.
[4:30:34] Boom. It didn't do that much. Darn. I was hoping it would be like insane.
[4:30:40] [Music] invigorating
[4:30:53] finesse and grace.
[4:31:02] I'm okay.
[4:31:10] Oh, come on. Got a tiny bit of health. Sweet. [Music]
[4:31:19] All right, this should be it. [Music] That was very defensive.
[4:31:26] Okay, King says this is a good way to gain levels. It takes a while and the battles start taking longer the further you get.
[4:31:33] More life bars and techniques get longer and more complicated. Uh, we'll do as much as I can today. Ooh, double braid
[4:31:39] white. I got a new hairdo. And energy tints also apply rush. We got time tint.
[4:31:45] Okay.
[4:31:52] Oh, okay. Someone did a uh a12 tip says another two bucks if you put the name
[4:31:59] Raone on top for an OG $3 tip. Tipping because I'm really surprised you're different. You're this different from the videos. Oh. Again, I'm really glad
[4:32:06] to hear that you think I'm different from the videos. However, we do now have an anonymous tipper who did five who is
[4:32:12] the the top tipper. So, sorry. You do have to be the top tipper technically to be on the leaderboard. So, you'd have to
[4:32:18] beat five bucks and then I put you up there as Raone. Okay. But thank you for the tip. I appreciate that. And I just got a $5 super chat from Scotty Doo. He
[4:32:26] I just want to send a few bucks before I take off. I always enjoy your streams. You're a good dude. Have fun with the rest of the tower. Thank you so much to
[4:32:31] Scotty Doo. I appreciate that very much. We've got about 45 minutes left on today's stream.
[4:32:39] I don't know how long we'll get in the challenge tower or how far we we will get into the tower, but we will keep going and keep trying.
[4:32:46] Let's keep it going. We're now on trial five. Thank you guys for the support. 45
[4:32:52] minutes left in the stream. If you'd like to support it, I would appreciate that.
[4:33:10] Blighted strike. This is the guy who gives blight to the whole party, remember? There's nothing you can do about it
[4:33:15] unless you're immune to it, which we're not. Well, I think one of us is. I think Lun is
[4:33:21] [Music] energized.
[4:33:32] [Music] Nice finesse and grace
[4:33:38] [Music] diary.
[4:33:44] Great. [Music]
[4:33:52] Now remove the blight from my L. Perfect. [Music]
[4:33:58] The elements dance. All right, let's break.
[4:34:04] Broke them flowing.
[4:34:20] Wow. [Music]
[4:34:26] Nothing buffed here. No. So, we'll just go for lamp blaster. Lamp master light again.
[4:34:37] Time to hit. All right, he's done.
[4:34:45] [Music] What's the highest tip I've ever gotten? Uh, in one singular tip, I want to say
[4:34:55] 2,000 bucks or like 2,100, something like that. It was during a marathon many years ago back when I was on Twitch. So,
[4:35:01] you're talking probably like 5 years ago. And ginormous tip came in during that stream. Like humongous. It was It
[4:35:08] was at least 2K, but I want to say it was like 21 and change or 22 or something like that.
[4:35:21] Okay.
[4:35:30] Of course, I missed the last hit. The last stinking hit.
[4:35:42] Killed the two minions right off the bat.
[4:35:48] Five hits. This would take the shield off. Yeah. Either one. The ghost tet whack applies
[4:35:55] defenseless. Let's try that.
[4:36:05] Yeah, that worked. Defenses work.
[4:36:11] [Music] FY
[4:36:23] [Music] targets defense. Let's play a second turn.
[4:36:30] Take down the shields on me. I didn't get the second turn. They lied.
[4:36:38] They completely lied. So much potential.
[4:37:03] Let's break. eyes beneath you
[4:37:12] invigorating. [Music]
[4:37:22] I'm down.
[4:37:28] Last chance. I can do it. Bald is correct. J man. in a entire
[4:37:35] party of baldies.
[4:37:42] No one defeats the Chrome Dome League. The Egghehead squad.
[4:37:49] All right, keep going.
[4:37:56] All right, this is the boss of stage five.
[4:38:06] Okay.
[4:38:14] [Music]
[4:38:26] Nice. Kill that guy with one hit.
[4:38:37] Please survive.
[4:38:48] Sucks.
[4:38:58] Third hit. I missed. [ __ ] [Music]
[4:39:18] Oh, bring him. There we go.
[4:39:24] [Music]
[4:39:42] I missed. You don't get to die yet. Feel
[4:39:50] [Music] the embrace of fire.
[4:39:59] Didn't do much. We gave them some burn at least.
[4:40:05] [Music] Ready to parach
[4:40:13] it too early and screwed it up. Damn it.
[4:40:18] I blew it. Be great.
[4:40:28] That was good. That was good damage.
[4:40:36] Nice. This will hurt.
[4:40:49] Got it. That's what I wanted. Nice death.
[4:40:56] Last chance.
[4:41:07] Brace yourself. Careful my
[4:41:22] [Music] go stab this.
[4:41:31] [Music]
[4:41:36] Keep stacking. Your turn to shine.
[4:41:48] Missed the six hit. Son of a [ __ ] Sucks that I lost it. Yeah. All right.
[4:41:58] Last chance. Time to hit big.
[4:42:04] Oh, wait. I had the green. I didn't realize I had it. I totally didn't realize I had a gamage. [ __ ]
[4:42:10] A storm. [Music]
[4:42:21] Yes. Big great damage. Oh, so close to being killed.
[4:42:29] [Music]
[4:42:38] Oh my god. Look. Sucks because look, if if he had a tiny
[4:42:43] bit more stun, I could have broken him with this, but I can't.
[4:42:53] [Music] Manuko Harry.
[4:42:59] Now he's starting. Yep. [Music]
[4:43:05] This will break it. Yeah, look. Fills the target's brake bar and breaks it. Extreme lightning damage. Let's try it.
[4:43:12] Haven't seen this yet. Nice. Sweet. I don't even know what that was.
[4:43:18] He dropped on him. [Music]
[4:43:31] Harry did it too early and she died.
[4:43:44] A proper challenge sucks.
[4:43:50] I won't lose again. I'm just going to revive everybody. I think probably the better thing to do.
[4:43:59] [Music] Oh, really?
[4:44:05] Oh, the soundtrack is outstanding. I love it.
[4:44:14] There we go. Beautiful counter.
[4:44:33] Yeah, I did like nothing. That was a waste. Okay.
[4:44:57] Too early. Damn it. It's all right to choose.
[4:45:05] We're really stacking this attack. He'll be dead in two more hits, I think. Oh, he's dead now. Never mind. The stacking
[4:45:12] added up and that was the end of that. Goodbye. Okay,
[4:45:18] that's right. The baldness helps with the aerodynamics of their moves. That's correct. I think that was trial five.
[4:45:27] Do some upgrades. [Music]
[4:45:33] That was it. She's the only one who leveled. A Okay.
[4:45:38] All right. We got a half an hour left on stream. How much further can we get in these endless tower trials?
[4:45:45] on the six.
[4:45:50] It likes you.
[4:45:58] [Music]
[4:46:06] Pretty cool. You're fighting all the different enemy groups of all the across the entire game right now.
[4:46:15] [Music] showing off all the abilities you've earned during the game. I guess the
[4:46:20] different enemy groups and how effective they are or aren't
[4:46:38] dead.
[4:46:43] [Music] Last chance.
[4:46:50] Okay. No.
[4:46:57] Oh, get the hell out of here. Big boy coming up in my face. Don't think so,
[4:47:03] son. Very nice. That was a quick one.
[4:47:08] [Music]
[4:47:15] These stupid fire horn. These are annoying. [Music]
[4:47:23] Brace yourselves. I can l literally infinitely counter
[4:47:28] this till he dies.
[4:47:39] Bit likes you. I mean, how dumb is this guy?
[4:47:49] Please survive. He's got a death wish.
[4:47:55] Okay. Complete [ __ ]
[4:48:06] Parry. Lun. Watch out.
[4:48:21] Wow. Amazing, huh? Pretty stupid. Okay.
[4:48:39] [Music]
[4:48:45] Time to hit big. Sucks. Now I can't do Stendle. Oh, yes I can.
[4:48:54] I thought Stendle was nine. It's only eight.
[4:49:00] Nicely done. Right to the boss. We're right to the stage six boss already.
[4:49:07] Let's go level up quick because I think Monokco leveled.
[4:49:13] Verso did too, but we're not using him. Oh, my did too. Okay. Well, I'm glad I'm doing this then.
[4:49:21] Here we go.
[4:49:29] Stage six boss. Here we go.
[4:49:34] Dark returns. Love
[4:49:45] brace yourself for my too early.
[4:50:04] Love this song.
[4:50:11] [Music]
[4:50:20] Almost dead, but not quite. [Music]
[4:50:31] Ready to carry.
[4:50:43] Sucks. I missed time the first hit.
[4:50:51] Forgot what kind of attack that was going to be.
[4:50:58] The elephant dance.
[4:51:05] Oh, if I do hell, I'll kill them both.
[4:51:14] Double kill. Nicely done.
[4:51:20] Better
[4:51:26] time to bleed. Stack the damage.
[4:51:39] Cannot break with this. Nope. Okay. Stack again.
[4:51:50] Snowstorm arrives. Oh no.
[4:51:56] Foolish move.
[4:52:01] Did it too early. Foolish move.
[4:52:09] Did it too early. [ __ ] Okay.
[4:52:15] [Music]
[4:52:21] I'm not giving up.
[4:52:26] [Music]
[4:52:31] like this. Poor Monokco.
[4:52:42] Beautiful. [Music]
[4:52:49] Go again. [Music]
[4:52:58] That suck. Let's start.
[4:53:07] Did it too early. [Music]
[4:53:15] Buried that [ __ ] [ __ ] you. Too much fun. Hey,
[4:53:21] [Music]
[4:53:27] now is our chance. [Music] Massive break.
[4:53:36] Yes. Fill that break meter. Yeah. My favorite part.
[4:53:45] Even though we probably would have beat him with the with the light attack, I want to just break in here just to confirm we're going to win.
[4:53:54] Let's do break point just for fun.
[4:54:00] And he kills him. That's awesome. Messy bun white and critical weakness
[4:54:07] 20% 25% increase critical chance on weakness. Okay. Woo. All right. Stage
[4:54:13] six done. So, we're more than halfway done now with the challenge tower. We got about 20 minutes left on the stream.
[4:54:19] I'll get as far as I can
[4:54:25] time and then probably what'll happen is we'll beat it next time and then we go to the final dungeon of the game in the
[4:54:30] end game of expedition 33. So again, if you are enjoying today's stream and you
[4:54:36] had a great time here, please engage and support. Please like the stream. Please
[4:54:42] like the video. Leave a comment on the video for engagement. But please, if you're here live, if you could support
[4:54:47] the stream, I would appreciate it. Sadly, Expedition 33 continues to be my least supported series right now, but I
[4:54:53] love it. [Music]
[4:55:01] Nice. Ready to evade.
[4:55:08] I can't believe I missed it. I suck. I missed the parry. I want to choose
[4:55:16] [Music] the carry.
[4:55:22] Nope. Violence.
[4:55:32] Don't care if you're resistant. Take it anyway. Invigorating. The dance begins.
[4:55:38] [Music] resist this.
[4:55:44] Damn, he didn't resist that. I'm ready.
[4:55:50] Last chance.
[4:55:57] Oh, it was faster than I anticipated. It got me good.
[4:56:05] [Music] Well, sadly this didn't really work. I was supposed to give a big break and
[4:56:11] didn't do anything. Pretty lame, actually.
[4:56:17] [Music]
[4:56:30] [Music]
[4:56:38] I'm ready. [Music] Nice. [Music]
[4:56:52] I can do do monster damage.
[4:57:00] Nice. Look at that.
[4:57:07] I twist it again. Grab energized. [Music]
[4:57:17] I feel energized. Great him.
[4:57:27] Very nice. I can do it.
[4:57:35] Last chance. I'm ready.
[4:57:41] Finish it. Sending
[4:57:47] easy. Very good.
[4:57:59] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Your turn to dance.
[4:58:06] [Music]
[4:58:14] Wow, that sucked.
[4:58:19] [Music]
[4:58:25] [Music] Take cover.
[4:58:38] Now's my favorite part.
[4:58:47] Sweetest. I wish I could break everyone at once. I don't have the ability to.
[4:59:00] [Music] and precision
[4:59:08] broken. Beautiful. I'm ready. [Music]
[4:59:22] [Music]
[4:59:33] Cam storm is coming. [Music] I can't see their Oh, they're about to
[4:59:39] break, too. Yeah, right. I can't It's hard to see. Yeah, I think so.
[4:59:47] They died. So, there you go.
[4:59:53] [Music]
[5:00:02] I died. [ __ ]
[5:00:13] [Music] Uh, we're done. This thing attacks too much.
[5:00:20] [Music] It's ridiculous. There's these crazy combos and it just keeps attacking over
[5:00:26] and over. Even though we stunned it, it got a million turns. So, he killed us. We got to start over.
[5:00:32] That's really frustrating actually cuz I didn't get outplayed. It's just a stupid enemy gets way too many attacks in a row
[5:00:39] and you need to parry them all. It wasn't like I played it poorly or
[5:00:46] anything. Your turn to shine.
[5:00:54] [Music]
[5:01:01] Oh my god. Again. It's so dumb. Now
[5:01:07] [Music]
[5:01:13] [Music] take cover.
[5:01:21] And they're all area of effect attacks. This is [ __ ] frustrating as [ __ ] It's pissing me off.
[5:01:35] Time to lead. [Music]
[5:01:42] Sucks. I can't break. It's
[5:01:48] [Music]
[5:01:54] going to go down exactly the same way. I'm not going to be able to do anything unless I parry perfectly. I can't stop this.
[5:02:01] Precision.
[5:02:06] Okay. [Music]
[5:02:15] Now it's our choice.
[5:02:20] [Music]
[5:02:32] Uh [Music]
[5:02:43] The storm has come [Music]
[5:02:48] in. [Music]
[5:02:54] Brace yourselves.
[5:02:59] Danger.
[5:03:07] [Music]
[5:03:18] I [ __ ] carry. God damn it. Challenge. It's very frustrating.
[5:03:30] [Music] You'll be ready.
[5:03:37] [Music]
[5:03:42] Nasty. [Music] Well, I can break again, which I
[5:03:49] probably should do. [Music]
[5:03:56] What a pain. Finesse and
[5:04:03] last chance. [Music]
[5:04:08] I'm ready.
[5:04:15] [Music]
[5:04:21] I wasn't ready. Yes.
[5:04:29] [Music]
[5:04:46] Almost dead, but we have to survive this attack. [Music]
[5:05:01] I did luckily. No, she has another one. I'm done.
[5:05:06] [Music]
[5:05:16] [ __ ] stupid. God, insane combo of stuff. Maybe the reserve
[5:05:22] team can win. Let's find out. Maybe the reserve team can win here. [Music]
[5:05:36] [Music]
[5:05:41] They got another turn.
[5:05:53] [Music] It keeps getting turned. Oh my god.
[5:06:00] Jesus.
[5:06:06] Ready to strike. Enter the line.
[5:06:12] [Music]
[5:06:34] is still didn't die. Take your shots.
[5:06:40] [Music]
[5:06:48] Oh my god. She gets two more turns.
[5:06:55] [Music]
[5:07:03] Oh my god, dude. This is so busted. It is so [ __ ] busted.
[5:07:11] It gets a million turns of ridiculous hit combos. It's nuts. Oh my god. That
[5:07:17] is a pain in the [ __ ] ass. And that's only trial 2. That's not even the boss.
[5:07:23] Oh my god. It likes you.
[5:07:36] [Music] Ready
[5:07:42] [Music]
[5:07:48] to parachute. What a pain. Your turn to dance.
[5:07:58] Of course. [Music]
[5:08:08] My lovely feet. [Music]
[5:08:18] Time to hit the finesse and precision.
[5:08:30] [Music]
[5:08:36] A storm is coming. [Music]
[5:08:51] Feeling better. [Music] Nope, that one cannot. Okay.
[5:08:58] [Music]
[5:09:06] Let's dance.
[5:09:16] Okay. [Music]
[5:09:24] [Music] [ __ ] man. This is pissing me off. What
[5:09:30] the [ __ ] My favorite part.
[5:09:35] Legit pissing me off [Music]
[5:09:40] violence. Yes. [Music]
[5:09:50] Blaz. [Music]
[5:09:58] Undone [Music]
[5:10:09] up. [Music]
[5:10:24] degrading
[5:10:30] violence. [Music]
[5:10:51] [Music] Got it. Finally. Jeez.
[5:10:57] Took ages. Okay. [Music]
[5:11:07] I killed it. Thank god. We're going to win now. Not looking good.
[5:11:17] [Music] So much potential.
[5:11:29] Let's shake the earth. Jeez, that was such a pain because it
[5:11:34] insanely long combo. Ridiculously insanely long combo. So
[5:11:41] crazy, man. Oh. All right, let's heal. We got one I want to do one more fight
[5:11:46] and that's the end of the stream for today. That was wildly hard because the thing did such a crazy long combo.
[5:11:53] [Music]
[5:11:58] Okay. Sheesh. All right. So, we're going to do the boss of stage seven. Uh, which will
[5:12:06] leave four more uh four more to go next time.
[5:12:12] Oh, I got an anonymous tip. How what is this? Hold on.
[5:12:23] See?
[5:12:30] Whoa. Really? I got an anonymous tip.
[5:12:36] All right. Japanese yen. It was a 5,000 yen tip and it says
[5:12:44] anonymous tip. It's $31.90. Wow. Well, thank you so much to this
[5:12:52] person for the $31 tip. Biggest contribution of the day by a
[5:12:58] mile.
[5:13:04] 30 3190.
[5:13:09] Wow. Thank you. That gets us to $99 of support for the Clear Obscure stream.
[5:13:20] And in reality, that's not bad. Compared to pre uh streams recently of Clear Obscure, that's pretty good. All right.
[5:13:28] All right. Final fight of the day right now. Then next time we pick this up at uh stage eight. This is tough stuff, but
[5:13:36] we're doing it. Okay.
[5:13:41] suck about that. [Music]
[5:13:46] Oh, it likes you.
[5:13:57] Please.
[5:14:02] We go. That was great damage. Damn.
[5:14:16] energized. Let's power it up.
[5:14:31] Miss the third hit begins. [Music]
[5:14:43] I could have stunned him, but I just want to do giant damage. Let's spill some ink.
[5:14:56] Okay. Night.
[5:15:09] like the dots.
[5:15:16] Now's our chance. That sucked. I lost virtuos.
[5:15:24] Quen fear. A storm is coming.
[5:15:31] Nothing great, honestly.
[5:15:42] Hard to see cuz it's dark in this fight. I can barely see anything. Watch out for
[5:15:52] what
[5:15:57] [Music] that damage is. Here
[5:16:05] it comes. And stack that damage. Now it's just the
[5:16:10] ultimate suck of
[5:16:26] last chance. [Music] Invigorating.
[5:16:36] Threshed. Stack that damage.
[5:16:44] Wow, great damage. The chance.
[5:16:49] That sucked. [Music] The elements.
[5:16:57] Probably kill him, right? I would think so. Hell.
[5:17:02] health. Well, I'll do lightning dance.
[5:17:08] It did zero. Wow. Zero. No damage at all. What a waste. Chroma is
[5:17:16] a brilliant light. Rise from your grave.
[5:17:24] Take cover. Just revived her. Your gods.
[5:17:33] [Music] Time to bleed.
[5:17:39] I didn't get a parry. That's weird. Oh well, let's kill him.
[5:17:45] This is so much easier than the last one. This was supposed to be the boss of stage seven and it was much easier than
[5:17:50] the middle. Okay. All right. Clay a hairdo. Not with color
[5:17:57] cuz there we had one without color. Fueling break. Breaking a target doubles its burn amount. Whoa. For a burn build,
[5:18:04] that could be insanely good. All right, guys. Great stream of expedition 33
[5:18:09] today. We are now really nearing the end. All we have to do is beat stages 8, 9, 10, and 11, and the final boss. Then
[5:18:17] we've got Renois, drafts, whatever it's called, and then Simon. And that is it. We've done everything in the base game
[5:18:23] of Expedition 33. So, next time I would assume we will beat the challenge tower and then on to the end and then probably
[5:18:29] maybe two more streams, right? We'll see. But guys, thank you. Great stream of expedition 33 today. For those that
[5:18:35] did engage, thank you so much. For those who supported, thank you so much. For those who trolled,
[5:18:41] I'll see you next time. Okay.
[5:18:47] All right. All right, guys. Good stuff.
[5:18:55] Thank you so much to everyone who chilled today. That was a good stream. And uh
[5:19:02] it's t it's not easy, man. This stuff is pretty darn difficult at this point, but the fact that I'm getting through it and
[5:19:09] it looks like we're going to get to the end game and actually fight Simon is pretty darn cool. It's been a long time coming, right? Okay.
[5:19:25] Nice rock music here. Okay. All right. Good stuff, guys. Um, remember
[5:19:35] I will be back tonight.
[5:19:43] Go. I'll be back tonight around
[5:19:49] 700 p.m. Pacific time. Ark Raiders. Tonight, I think what we're going to do
[5:19:54] for Arc Raiders, which will be pretty fun, is do random drops in all the different maps um for variety. I don't
[5:20:00] think tonight I'm particularly going to look for any items. I think tonight instead I just want to explore the maps,
[5:20:05] look for loot, see what I can find, have some fun because I've been so hyper focused on getting the items to upgrade
[5:20:13] that I think that it's actually held back some of the fun I'm having with this game. So, I think tonight I don't want to do that. I just want to kind of
[5:20:18] like explore for myself on a variety of maps and go from there. Okay, good
[5:20:23] stuff. I hope to see you tonight for that. If not, tomorrow is my most disappointing game of the year countdown
[5:20:28] in the morning. Then we're going to do more Pokemon streaming and then tomorrow night it is Call of Duty Black Ops 7.
[5:20:35] All right guys, thank you. Great stream. See you tonight. Peace out. See you then.
[5:20:43] [Music]
[5:21:57] [Music]
[5:23:05] Devour. Devour.
